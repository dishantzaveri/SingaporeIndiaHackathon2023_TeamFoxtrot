Borders II,</i> 00 Civ. 1963 (VM) (Southern District of New York)</b>, SEC SETTLES CLAIMS INVOLVING INSIDER TRADING AGAINST THREE DEFENDANTS  , The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) today announced that the Honorable Victor Marrero of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York entered Final Judgments of permanent injunction and other relief against defendants James Cooper (Cooper) and Deon Benson (Benson) of Bowling Green, Kentucky on December 23, 2002, and against defendant Richard Zelman (Zelman) of Nyack, New York on December 20, 2002.  These judgments settle the Commissions claims against these three defendants in a civil action filed by the Commission on March 14, 2000, alleging that from 1997 through January 2000, these defendants and others engaged in a widespread insider trading scheme that produced over $8 million in illegal profits from trading in the securities of 23 public companies.  , The Commissions Complaint alleged that John Freeman, a temporary word-processing employee at Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., Inc. and later Credit Suisse First Boston, tipped a number of defendants about merger and acquisition transactions involving clients of those investment banking firms.  The Complaint alleged that Freeman and two individuals he met in an Internet chat room, Benton Erskine and James Cooper, launched the insider trading scheme.  Cooper traded in advance of sixteen transactions and realized profits of $227,192.  Cooper also tipped several persons who traded and realized profits of over $1 million collectively.  One of Coopers tippees, Deon Benson, traded in advance of ten transactions and realized profits of $838,982.  The Complaint also alleges that Benson tipped his broker, who traded and realized profits of $84,150.  Freeman also provided tips to his neighbor, Richard Zelman.  Zelman did not purchase securities; however, the complaint alleges he did tip his friend in Florida who purchased securities in advance of four transactions and realized profits of $200,905.    , Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of Final Judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder.  Cooper was ordered to pay disgorgement in the amount of $1,267,674 with pre-judgment interest in the amount of $520,666, but payment was waived for the amount exceeding $57,650 based upon his sworn Statement of Financial Condition.  Benson was ordered to pay disgorgement in the amount of $923,132 with pre-judgment interest in the amount of $356,399, but payment was waived for the amount exceeding $250,000 based upon his sworn Statement of Financial Condition.  Zelman was ordered to pay disgorgement in the amount of $200,905 with pre-judgment interest in the amount of $55,788, but payment of the full amount was waived based upon his sworn Statement of Financial Condition.  Civil penalties were not imposed against defendants Cooper, Benson, and Zelman based upon each defendants sworn Statement of Financial Condition.  Cooper, Benson, and Zelman each previously pleaded guilty in parallel criminal proceedings handled by the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York.     , <u>See also</u>:  L.R. 16469 (March 14, 2000); L.R. 17267 (December 12, 2001); and L.R.  17501 (May 2, 2002)<!--<IMG SRC=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=9 ALT= BORDER=0>  <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp17912.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>--><!-- End text -->,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17912.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Ill., Eastern Division)   , On December 11, 2002, a Federal Court jury in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (Eastern Division) convicted five defendants on charges arising from a fraudulent prime bank trading scheme.  Frank L. Peitz (Peitz), Daniel B. Benson (Benson), Randall W. Law (Law), Monica Iles (Iles), and Robert D. Paladino (Paladino) were each convicted of multiple felonies involving the offer and sale of the fraudulent program through Lennox Investment Group, Ltd. (Lennox), an entity owned and controlled by Law, and the subsequent misappropriation of approximately more than $11 million collected from investors.     , Peitz, Benson, Law, Iles and Paladino were each convicted of eight counts of wire fraud.  Peitz, Benson and Paladino were also convicted of six counts of money laundering and one count of money laundering conspiracy.  The same three defendants were each acquitted of one additional money laundering count.  A sixth defendant, Peter A. Loutos, an attorney, pleaded guilty before trial to a superceding count of fraud in connection with a bank application.  The evidence presented at trial showed that between 1996 and 1998, the five defendants, acting through Lennox and other entities they controlled, sought and obtained funds from individuals by purportedly selling investments in the nonexistent international trading of bank financial instruments.  Through Lennox alone, the evidence demonstrated, defendants collected more than $11 million.  In the course of the scheme, the defendants made material misstatements and omissions, including the following: (1) investor funds would be used in the international trading of bank instruments; (2) investor funds would be held in an escrow account or that collateral of equal value would insure the safety of investor funds; (3) investor principal was guaranteed; (4) investors would receive returns of 122 per cent per week for forty weeks during the one year term of their investment; and (5) the trading program was regulated and approved by governmental entities such as the Federal Reserve and the International Monetary Fund.  In fact, the evidence established, the purported trading program did not exist and investor funds were not used to trade banking instruments.  Rather, the defendants systematically disbursed investor funds for the benefit of themselves and their designees.    , The charges brought in the criminal proceeding were based on the same conduct alleged in a civil action brought by the Commissions Fort Worth District Office in June 1998. [<i>SEC v. Lennox Investment Group, Ltd., et al.</i>, USDC/ND/TX [Fort Worth Division], Civil Action No. 498-CV-536-Y].    , In the criminal proceeding, the Commission staff assisted the United States Attorneys Office by providing documents and sworn testimony obtained during the Commissions investigation and litigation.  An attorney with the Commission also testified at the criminal trial.   , For more information on prime bank fraud, investors are advised to access the Commissions Prime Bank Investor Alert that provides tips on how to avoid being a victim of these scams.

FOR POST INJUNCTION SECURITIES SALES CONDUCTED ON INTERNET AND FOR FAILURE TO PAY AS PREVIOUSLY ORDERED, The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced today that on December 18, 2002 Judge Frank J. Polozola of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana held a show cause hearing and issued an order finding defendant Harral Dunbar, Jr., in contempt of the Courts preliminary and permanent injunctions for securities sales over the Internet, which occurred between the entry of the preliminary and permanent injunctions, and after the entry of the permanent injunction.  The Court also found Dunbar in contempt of its order directing payment of disgorgement, prejudgment interest and a civil penalty, as a result of his failure to pay.  In earlier orders, the Court preliminarily and later permanently enjoined Dunbar from antifraud and registration violations of the federal securities laws.  In imposing the preliminary injunction, the Court found that Dunbar, of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, owned the Ghost International website and used it to solicit investors in investment contracts by promises of inordinate amounts of guaranteed returns and promises of no-risk investing, and further found that investors have received little or no return despite several months of promises by Dunbar that returns would be paid.  The Court also previously ordered Dunbar to pay disgorgement in the amount of $9,600, along with prejudgment interest thereon, and ordered Dunbar to pay a third tier statutory civil penalty in the amount of $120,000.   , The Court found that Dunbar, after the entry of the injunctions against him, obtained funds from two investors who purchased the securities by touting Ghost Internationals private contribution and investment program which allegedly paid, for example, $100,000 on a $200 investment over a few weeks.  As with the earlier sales, Dunbar made various promises of exorbitant returns.  Dunbar made various representations to fraudulently induce the investors, including that his company dealt in high yield investments and that funds were to be placed in offshore bank accounts, which would pay promised returns for five months of a supposed seven-month program.  The Court ordered Dunbar to pay a compensatory fine in the amount of $6,600.  , The preliminary and permanent injunctions prohibited Dunbar from further violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.      , <u>See also</u>:  <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17894.htm>L.

(Robertson Stephens), for issuing fraudulent research reports.  The Commission alleges that Johnson issued research reports and made public statements regarding mergers proposed by two public companies in which he failed to disclose that he had conflicts of interest because he owned stock that, upon completion of each of the mergers, would yield enormous financial windfalls for Johnson.  The Commission further alleges that, in 2001, Johnson issued false and misleading Buy recommendations on another public company that were inconsistent with his privately-held belief., According to the Commissions Complaint, in 1999 and 2000, Johnson provided positive research coverage on Redback Networks, Inc. and Sycamore Networks, Inc., after they had announced proposed mergers with private companies.  Johnson praised both mergers in his research reports and media statements, but failed to disclose that his supposedly objective advice was infected by serious conflicts of interest.  In both cases, he owned stock in the private companies that would be exchanged for public company shares if the mergers were completed, creating multimillion-dollar windfalls for Johnson.  In acquiring his holdings in the private companies that were the subjects of the merger proposals, Johnson violated Robertson Stephens internal policy that required employees to obtain prior written approval from the firm for all private investments.  Moreover, at the time that Johnson issued his reports and statements concerning the proposed mergers, he did not disclose his personal holdings in the affected companies or the magnitude of his financial interest in the outcome of the mergers. , The Complaint further alleges that in January 2001, Johnson spoke privately about Corvis Corporation, another company that he covered, to a committee that was responsible for making investment decisions for a group of partnerships that had been formed by Robertson Stephens and senior Robertson Stephens executives and in which Johnson and other senior Robertson Stephens executives were investors.  In response to a question, Johnson told the committee that he would not buy Corvis stock at the prevailing market price, but would buy at a price that was approximately half of the current price.  Johnsons statements to the committee directly contradicted his existing Buy recommendation on Corvis.  After Johnson spoke, the committee voted to sell all the Corvis stock held by two partnerships.  In addition, the day after he made his private recommendation to the committee, Johnson sold nearly all of his Corvis stock.  Two days after his stock sale, Johnson issued another research report reiterating his buy recommendation on Corvis, but failed to disclose that he had sold his Corvis stock two days earlier., The Complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Johnson with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exhange Act Rule 10b-5, which prohibit the making of false or misleading statements in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.  The Complaint also charges Johnson with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, which prohibits the making of material false or misleading statements and failing to disclose material facts in the offer or sale of securities., The Commission seeks a permanent injunction against Johnson, disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties., The Commission also instituted and simultaneously settled administrative proceedings against Robertson Stephens.  The Commission found that Robertson Stephens published materially misleading research reports in violation of Section 15(c) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 15c1-2(b), and Robertson Stephens failed reasonably to supervise a research analyst with a view toward preventing violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws arising from undisclosed conflicts of interest caused by the analysts personal investments.  The order also found that Robertson Stephens failed to preserve e-mails for the required three-year period and/or failed to preserve its e-mails in an accessible place for two years, and failed promptly to furnish e-mails to the Commission., The Commission censured Robertson Stephens and ordered the firm to pay disgorgement, including prejudgment interest, of $885,000 and a penalty of $4,115,000, for a total of $5 million.  Robertson Stephens consented to the entry of the order against it without admitting or denying the findings contained in the order., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp17922.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  ]"

Robertson Stephens, Inc., </i>Civil Action No. 03 0027  (D.D.C.)</h2>, <h2>SEC Sues Robertson Stephens, Inc. for Profit Sharing in Connection with Initial Public Offerings; Robertson Stephens, Inc. Consents to Pay $28 Million</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a civil action against Robertson Stephens, Inc., a San Francisco-based brokerage firm and investment bank, relating to the firms allocation of shares in Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) during 1999 and 2000.  In its complaint, the Commission alleges that Robertson Stephens, which underwrote more than 75 IPOs in this period, wrongfully obtained millions of dollars from over 100 customer by allocating shares of hot IPOs to these customers and receiving, in return, profits - in the form of excessive commissions or markdowns - made by these customers on their IPO stock.  Robertson Stephens has agreed to settle this matter., The Commissions complaint alleges that Robertson Stephens violated NASD Conduct Rules that prohibit profit sharing in customer accounts and unjust or inequitable conduct, as well as books and records requirements of the federal securities laws.  In settlement of this matter, and without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Robertson Stephens has agreed to pay a total of $28 million to resolve the Commissions action and a related action brought by the NASD.  The firm also has agreed to be enjoined from future violations of the NASD rules and books and records provisions described above.  The $28 million payment is composed of $23 million in disgorgement of improper gains and $5 million in civil penalties. , The Commissions complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, includes the following allegations:, In 1999 and 2000, Robertson Stephens allocated IPO shares to certain institutional accounts that shared their IPO profits with the firm by paying unusually large commissions on secondary trades in highly liquid, exchange-traded securities.  In some instances, these accounts paid back commissions to Robertson Stephens that were over 4,000% higher than the commissions customarily paid by institutions.  For example, instead of a typical commission of $.06 per share on secondary trades, these institutional accounts paid Robertson Stephens commissions ranging up to $2.50, with a small number of trades over $2.50.  , There was no economic purpose for these commission generating secondary trades, which were typically executed the day before the IPO, the day of the IPO, and shortly after the IPO.  Indeed, some of the accounts engaged in offsetting trades, where they purchased or sold securities through Robertson Stephens and at the same time executed the other side of the trade through another brokerage firm.  Although the purchase and sale often were executed at a similar price, payment of the significant commission to Robertson Stephens resulted in a net loss to the account. , Robertson Stephens wrongful conduct mainly involved certain hedge funds and other small institutional accounts that did not generate enough ordinary commission business under Robertson Stephens allocation practices to warrant the IPO allocations they wanted or received.  Taking advantage of the high demand for IPO shares during this period, certain Robertson Stephens personnel pressured these institutional accounts to increase their business in secondary trades with Robertson Stephens in order to raise their rank to get IPO allocations.  These accounts increased their rank and shared profits through the payment of the unusually large commissions on their secondary trades with Robertson Stephens., Certain institutional accounts paid high commissions based on how much money they made on a particular hot IPO.  On hot IPO days, many of these accounts would place their orders for trades on the markets opening, but would not place commissions on the trade until later in the day after the account determined how much money they made or would make by flipping the IPO.  Because of the pressure they faced to increase their rank in order to obtain or increase their IPO allocations, certain institutional accounts determined a percentage of profits to repay the firm in order to maintain their rank and obtain IPO shares.  Certain institutional accounts repaid the firm about 25% to 30% of their profits on successful IPO deals., Robertson Stephens also improperly shared in the profits of some of its large retail accounts serviced by its Financial Services Department (FSD).  Some FSD brokers, who had discretion in allocating IPO shares to their customers, reminded their customer accounts about IPO profits and also asked them to engage in trades in return.  These retail accounts shared profits by paying unusually high commissions on other secondary trades or high markdowns when they sold their IPO shares back to Robertson Stephens., Certain Robertson Stephens management and syndicate personnel were informed that Robertson Stephens was sharing in IPO profits.  This is reflected in e-mail messages and other communications cited in the complaint., <p class=center>*   *   *, Robertson Stephens has consented, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint, to the entry of a final judgment that: (1) permanently enjoins Robertson Stephens from violating NASD Conduct Rules 2110 (just and equitable principles of trade) and 2330 (prohibition against profit-sharing), and Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 17a-3(a)(6); (2) orders Robertson Stephens to pay disgorgement of $23 million, which would be reduced to $11.5 million in recognition of the firms payment of $11.5 million in the related NASD proceeding; and (3) orders Robertson Stephens to pay a civil penalty of $5 million, which would be reduced to $2.5 million in recognition of Robertson Stephens payment of a $2.5 million penalty to NASD in its related proceeding., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of NASD in the investigation of this matter., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp17923.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17923.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Commissions complaint charges Jeffrey M. Kalina, Homestores former senior manager of mergers and acquisitions, with participating in a financial fraud scheme involving round-trip transactions in which Homestore used its own cash to generate revenues and thereby meet Wall Street expectations.  Kalina, 31, of Woodland Hills, California, has agreed to settle the Commissions lawsuit, to plead guilty to criminal charges, and to cooperate with the government in its investigation., The Commissions civil complaint and the Department of Justices criminal charges, which were both filed this morning in United States District Court in Los Angeles, allege that Kalina assisted senior Homestore executives in a scheme to inflate revenues during 2001 through the round-trip transactions that had no economic substance and to conceal the improper conduct from the companys independent auditors.  As a result of the fraudulent scheme, Homestore overstated advertising revenues by $46 million (64 percent) for the first three quarters of 2001 and total revenues by up to 15 percent, causing the company to report false and misleading financial information to shareholders and to the public in its Form 10-Q quarterly reports., The Commissions complaint further alleges that Kalina knew that the round-trip transactions had no economic substance and that Homestores reporting of revenues from these transactions violated generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Nevertheless, he assisted management in implementing the scheme and concealing parts of the transactions from the auditors., The Commission charged Kalina with securities fraud, falsifying Homestores books and records, and aiding and abetting Homestores reporting and record-keeping violations, as well as Homestore managements lying to an accountant violations. Kalina settled the Commissions lawsuit without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. Kalina agreed to the entry of an order that (1) permanently enjoins him from committing future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-13, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder; and (2) requires him to disgorge $74,348, including interest, from the exercise of his Homestore stock options during his involvement in the fraudulent scheme. These funds will be paid to the benefit of Homestore shareholders.  Additionally, Kalina has agreed to the entry of a public administrative proceeding pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commissions Rules of Practice, suspending him from practicing or appearing before the Commission as an accountant., In the related criminal case, Kalina has agreed to plead guilty to a one-count information charging him with securities fraud. In a plea agreement also filed this morning, Kalina admitted that he coordinated the efforts of Homestore sales staff in connection with the fraudulent transactions, thereby causing false and misleading statements to be made to the investing public about Homestores revenues. The criminal case closely mirrors the allegations made in the Commissions complaint. The charge against Kalina carries a maximum possible penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine., The Commission and the U.S. Attorneys office previously charged three other former executives for their involvement in the round-trip scheme. John Giesecke, Jr., Homestores former chief operating officer; Joseph J. Shew, the companys former chief financial officer; and John DeSimone, Homestores former vice president of transactions, have all pleaded guilty to criminal charges, settled the Commissions civil charges, and agreed to collectively pay almost $5 million in disgorgement and civil penalties., At the time of the violations, Homestore was one of the top Internet portals for real estate and related services. Homestore, Inc. (formerly Homestore.com Inc.) is based in Westlake Village, California. Homestore provides Internet real estate listings on Realtor.com and related websites., This civil case is the product of an ongoing investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The relief was obtained against all defendants in an emergency lawsuit the Commission filed on December 30, 2002, which charged Leon Jordan II, Jordan Enterprises, LLC, Jordan Holdings, LLC, Raymond Brown, and Ray Brown &amp; Associates with securities fraud and with operating as unregistered broker-dealers.  The Commissions complaint also named Jordans wife, Sheila S. Jordan, as a relief defendant who was unjustly enriched by receiving proceeds from the defendants fraudulent scheme. , Contemporaneous with the filing of the lawsuit on December 30, the Commission sought and obtained from the Court an order that, among other things, temporarily froze the assets of the defendants and relief defendant, temporarily restrained the defendants from continuing their violations of the securities laws, and ordered the defendants and relief defendant to retain relevant documents.  In its order on January 9, the Court granted similar relief to continue until a hearing on the merits, finding that the Commission had demonstrated a strong likelihood that it will prevail at trial on the merits of the case.  The Court also ordered the defendants and relief defendant to provide discovery on an expedited basis and to prepare and deliver to the Commission a detailed and complete schedule of all of their personal assets and a description of the sources of all funds they have obtained from the conduct alleged in the complaint.  , The Commissions complaint alleges that since at least December 2001, the defendants have fraudulently raised at least $850,000 by offering unwitting individuals and entities seeking venture capital (the participants) the opportunity, for a fee, to receive proceeds from bond offerings that do not exist.  According to the complaint, the defendants have falsely represented to participants that: (1) they are the exclusive coordinators and intermediaries of several multi-billion dollar bond offerings in which well known large financial institutions are involved; (2) in exchange for a fee (denominated as a due diligence fee), the defendants will assist the participants in obtaining the proceeds of a specific bond offering; and (3) the participants fees will be refunded if the defendants are unable to secure participation in the proceeds of the bond offering for the participants.  The complaint alleges that the well-known financial institutions purportedly involved in the defendants bond offerings have in fact disclaimed any involvement in any bond offering with the defendants, and that there is no evidence that any of the bond offerings exist, or have ever existed.  The complaint further alleges that none of the participants have received any funding from the defendants, that the defendants have not returned any portion of the participants fees, and that the defendants are continuing to solicit funds from other potential participants.  , The named defendants and relief defendant are:, , , , , , , The Commissions complaint charges the defendants with committing securities fraud in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and with operating as unregistered broker-dealers in violation of Section 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  In addition to the relief already ordered by the Court, the Commission is requesting the Court to enjoin the defendants from violating the federal securities laws, order them to disgorge ill-gotten gains with interest, and impose civil penalties against them.  The Commission is also requesting the Court to order relief defendant Sheila S.

Citron, Michael McCarty, and Erik Maschler with participating in an extensive fraudulent scheme involving the Nasdaq Stock Markets Small Order Execution System (SOES) from 1993 to June 2001.  Defendants carried out the scheme from 1993 through March 1998 at the former Datek Securities Corporation.  Sheldon Maschler, McCarty, and Erik Maschler continued the scheme from April 1998 to June 2001 at defendant Heartland Securities Corporation, which had purchased Datek Securities day-trading business in March 1998.  The Commission also charges Aaron Elbogen and Moishe Zelcer with aiding and abetting Datek Securities violations of certain recordkeeping and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws.  Defendants have agreed to pay over $70 million in penalties and disgorgement to settle the matter.  Of the total penalties, Sheldon Maschler will pay approximately $29.2 million and Citron will pay approximately $22.5 million.  , The Commissions complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Sheldon Maschler, 58, Citron, 32, McCarty, 39, and Erik Maschler, 32, with devising and orchestrating a scheme to access and use the SOES system for unlawful proprietary trading.  Until mid-2001, NASD rules restricted use of the SOES system to small retail customer orders, and prohibited broker-dealers from using SOES to trade for their own accounts.  According to the complaint, Sheldon Maschler, Citron, McCarty, and Erik Maschler accessed the SOES system to execute millions of unlawful proprietary trades, generating tens of millions of dollars in illegal profits.  The complaint further alleges that these defendants hid their fraudulent use of the SOES system from regulators by allocating the trades to dozens of nominee accounts, creating fictitious books and records, and filing false reports with the Commission.  , The Commission today also charged Sheldon Maschler and McCarty in connection with a separate, yet similar, fraudulent scheme involving the conversion of three New York savings and loan institutions from mutual ownership to stock ownership.  In violation of federal and state banking regulations, Maschler and McCarty entered into agreements with numerous depositors to obtain their subscription rights and then fraudulently used those rights to purchase shares of the banks initial public offerings.  Maschler and McCarty later sold the conversion stock on the open market, realizing illegal profits of $1,788,472.  Defendants Raft Investments, Inc. and JES Management Corporation, a corporation owned by Sheldon Maschler, aided and abetted the bank conversion scheme by providing the funds used to obtain the depositors subscription rights.  , <p align=center><b>The Commissions Complaint</b>, The Commissions federal court complaint includes the following allegations:, The SOES system, established by the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) in 1984, was an automated trading system designed to benefit small investors by providing automatic execution of small Nasdaq orders at the best available price.  SOES was the only Nasdaq trading system offering such features.  , From at least 1993 to March 1998, defendants Sheldon Maschler, Citron, McCarty, and Erik Maschler controlled Datek Securities through its Manhattan branch, then a day-trading operation that was the profit center for the entire firm.  The firm used a day-trading software known as Watcher, the speed and features of which enabled its traders to react quickly to market activity.  Although there were other means of executing securities transactions with Nasdaq market makers, only SOES offered automatic execution, thereby increasing the timing advantage offered by Watcher.  , Instead of using SOES for its lawful purpose -- to execute trades on behalf of individual investors -- defendants Sheldon Maschler, Citron, McCarty, and Erik Maschler engaged in a massive fraudulent scheme to execute millions of proprietary trades on the SOES system.  From 1995 through March 1998, Datek Securities executed approximately 12 million SOES trades, over 30 percent of all SOES trades.  , To hide their proprietary trading, defendants Sheldon Maschler, Citron, McCarty, and Erik Maschler established dozens of nominee accounts, and paid nominees a guaranteed and fixed rate of return in exchange for the use of their identities and complete discretionary trading authority.  , From 1993 to 1994, at the direction of Sheldon Maschler, Citron, McCarty, and Erik Maschler, Datek Securities employees manually allocated Datek Securities trades among accounts after the close of the market.  Beginning in early 1994, the unlawful allocation process was automated and carried out through a sophisticated software program developed for the firm and known as Wire.  Wire dramatically enhanced defendants ability to conceal their proprietary SOES trading.  The software was ultimately refined to allocate trades among nominee customer accounts as the trades occurred.  , Beginning in 1997, Sheldon Maschler and Citron began funding nominee accounts with profits generated from the SOES scheme.  Defendant Raft Investments, Inc., a corporation then controlled by Sheldon Maschler and Citron, provided at least $50 million to fund more than 125 nominee accounts at Datek Securities.   , The unlawful proprietary trading scheme resulted in substantial profits, the majority of which were paid to Sheldon Maschler and Citron.  Defendants Elbogen, 54, then Datek Securities chief executive officer, and Zelcer, 56, the firms former chief compliance officer and financial operations principal, aided and abetted certain books and records and reporting violations by falsely classifying payments of the firms trading profits to entities controlled by Sheldon Maschler and Citron, and by failing to disclose that Sheldon Maschler and Citron were control persons of the firm., On March 30, 1998, Datek Securities sold its day-trading operations to Heartland, a registered broker-dealer then owned by Erik Maschler and Elbogen.  Sheldon Maschler, McCarty, and Erik Maschler controlled Heartland, and continued the unlawful SOES trading scheme from April 1998 through June 2001.  Nearly all of the nominee accounts at Datek Securities were transferred to Heartland, and the methods used to conceal the scheme continued unabated.  , <p align=center><b>The Settlement</b>, Defendants have agreed to settle this matter without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  The settlement terms are subject to court approval. , Sheldon Maschler, Citron, and McCarty have consented to final judgments permanently enjoining each from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 15(b) and 17(a)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rules 15b3-1, 15b7-1, 17a-3(a)(1), 17a-3(a)(2), 17a-3(a)(3), 17a-3(a)(7), 17a-3(a)(9), and 17a-3(a)(12) thereunder.

LEVINE IN CONNECTION WITH FALSIFICATION OF RECORDS, The SEC today filed a civil action against Joshua M. Levine for his role in developing software programs used by the former Datek Securities Corporation to conceal its improper trading activities on the Nasdaq Stock Markets Small Order Execution System (SOES) from 1994 to 1997.  Levine, 34, was the primary software developer for the firm during that period.  Levine has agreed to settle the charges by paying a $1 million penalty and consenting to an injunction for aiding and abetting violations of certain broker-dealer books and records provisions of the federal securities laws.  , In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the Commission alleged that Levine knowingly developed, implemented, and refined software programs that substantially assisted Datek Securities in the falsification and fabrication of its books and records.  The complaint alleged that:, At the time, NASD rules prohibited broker-dealers from using the SOES system to trade for their own accounts.  Nevertheless, Datek Securities executed millions of proprietary trades using the SOES system.    , Initially, the firm concealed its proprietary trading by manually allocating the trades among dozens of nominee accounts at the end of each day.  After the trades were allocated, the information was used to generate additional firm books and records that falsely recorded the proprietary trades as those of individual retail customers., Levine aided and abetted the firms scheme to falsify its books and records.   , In 1994, Levine, with assistance from others, developed a software program known as Wire that automated the unlawful trade allocation process.  Among other things, Levine programmed Wire to give the firms books and records the appearance that they complied with federal securities laws and NASD rules. , Levine continually made refinements to Wire.  By 1995, Levine had developed Real Time Wire, which allocated trades among nominee customer accounts as the trades occurred.  Thus, Levine created and refined software programs that falsely recorded the proprietary securities transactions as customer transactions.  , , Levine has agreed to settle this matter, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, by consenting to a final judgment ordering him to pay a $1 million penalty and permanently enjoining him from aiding and abetting violations of the following broker-dealer books and records provisions:  Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 17a-3(a)(1), 17a-3(a)(2), 17a-3(a)(3), and 17a-3(a)(7) promulgated thereunder.

According to the Commissions complaint, Williams learned of the Micromass shortfall at a meeting with other high-level Waters and Micromass executives on June 12, 2001.  The Commissions complaint alleges that Williams then sold 10,000 shares of Waters on June 18, 2001, just hours before Waters issued an announcement that its earnings for the second quarter of 2001 would be substantially lower than it previously had forecast due to lower than expected sales at Micromass.  According to the Commissions complaint, by selling prior to the announcement, Williams avoided a loss of $103,659., The Commissions complaint alleges that Williams sold his shares in breach of a fiduciary duty to Waters and its shareholders not to trade in the companys stock while in possession of material, nonpublic information about the company.

Lemcke pled guilty on September 24, 2002 to one count of fraud under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and nine counts of wire fraud.  The criminal indictment, which was based on the same facts as a civil fraud action the Commission filed against Lemcke on November 6, 2001, alleged that from at least March 1996 through September 2001, Lemcke defrauded five of his investment advisory clients of several hundred thousand dollars.  According to the indictment, Lemcke obtained funds from his clients with false promises that he would invest the funds in various securities, and in some cases induced his clients to liquidate existing investments.

(Premier), an entity controlled by him that has its principal place of business in Los Angeles.  The Court: (1) granted the Commissions application for a temporary restraining order; (2) placed a freeze on the defendants assets; (3) prohibited the destruction of documents by the defendants; (4) ordered accountings from the defendants; and (5) granted expedited discovery.  , The Commissions complaint, filed yesterday, alleges that, since November 2000, Richmond and Premier have raised at least $4.5 million from dozens of investors in at least eight states, purportedly for the purpose of investing in a variety of high-yield investment programs.  The defendants represented that investors could earn returns of up to 200% per month through the programs, which included high-yield promissory notes, bridge loans and the purchase and sale of precious metals.  In fact, Richmond and Premier have been operating a prime-bank scheme and are misappropriating investor funds and using the funds for, among other things: (1) Richmonds personal expenses, including limousines, armed guards and a down payment on a $1.5 million house in Encino, California; (2) working capital for Premier Pictures, a company owned by Richmond that produced adult films and operated an adult website; (3) other failed business ventures of Richmond, including a forfeited deposit made in connection with the aborted purchase of a male strip club; and (4) the operational costs of maintaining Premiers fraudulent scheme, including office rental and employee salaries.  In addition, although investor funds did not generate any income, Richmond and Premier paid purported profits, interest payments and fees to certain individuals in an attempt to perpetuate a Ponzi-like scheme to enable Richmond to continue to raise funds from unwary investors.  , The Commission obtained an order temporarily restraining Richmond and Premier from committing securities fraud in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

In August 2002, iNTELEFILM filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy., The Commissions complaint alleges that in 1999 Phong Nguyen was employed as an emerging markets developer for AT&amp;T and was working directly with iNTELEFILM to develop an Internet-based product, Intelesource.org.  Chanh Nguyen, a close friend of Phong Nguyen, worked for Business Integration Services-an agent of AT&amp;T that was procuring computer hardware for Intelesource.org.  While working on the Intelesource.org project, Phong and Chanh Nguyen learned that iNTELEFILM planned to publicly announce Intelesource.org on December 8, 1999.  In the five trading days immediately before the announcement, Phong and Chanh Nguyen purchased 76,000 shares of iNTELEFILM stock.  They profited by over $200,000 when the price of iNTELEFILM stock more than doubled immediately after the announcement.  The complaint also alleges that Chanh Nguyen illegally tipped his father to purchase iNTELEFILM stock, which his father did two days before the announcement.  The complaint does not allege, however, that Chanh Nguyens father acted illegally.  , The Commission charges the defendants with securities fraud in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.  The Commission seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten trading profits, prejudgment interest and civil penalties. , The Commission staff acknowledges the assistance of NASD in connection with this matter.,  , <!--<P><IMG SRC=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=9 ALT= BORDER=0>  <A href=/litigation/complaints/comp17940.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</A></P>--><i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17940.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Joe Fish has assessed civil penalties, fines and attorneys fees in excess of $290,000 against Johnson for conduct in contempt of a final judgment signed by Judge Fish in 1996.  On December 9, 2002, Judge Fish signed an Order Setting Additional Fines and Setting Amount of Attorneys Fees to be Paid by Marlen V. Johnson Pursuant to Order of Contempt (December 9 Order).  The December 9 Order supplements the Order Holding Defendant Marlen V. Johnson in Civil Contempt for Failure to Comply with Court Orders, Granting Sanctions for Contempt and Granting Other Post-Judgment Relief, entered by the Court on September 24, 2002 (September 24 Order) [see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17750.htm>LR 17750</a>/September 26, 2002]., Both the September 24 Order and December 9 Order arise from Johnsons violations of the terms of an Agreed Final Judgment entered by Judge Fish on April 7, 1996.

The judgment also permanently enjoined Johnson from, among other things, future violations of the antifraud and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws.,  Judge Fish found that Johnson violated the final judgment from at least October 19, 2001, to the present by acting as an officer and director of a public company, including, but not limited to, Voyager Group, Inc., Neoteric, Inc., and R&amp;RX Group, Inc.  Judge Fish further found that Johnson violated the antifraud and reporting provisions of the final judgment by causing reports to be filed with the Commission that omitted to disclose material information.  Specifically, Forms 10-K and 10-Q that Johnson signed and filed on behalf of Voyager and Neoteric failed to disclose that Johnson, while acting as president, secretary and a director of these companies, was nonetheless subject to the final judgment barring him from acting as an officer or director.  Moreover, Johnson failed to disclose any portion of the 1996 final judgment against him., Johnson ignored the Courts initial order to show cause and failed to appear at a contempt hearing held by Judge Fish on September 24, 2002.  Pursuant to the September 24 Order, Judge Fish issued a bench warrant requiring the arrest and incarceration of Johnson and ordered the assessment of daily coercive fines until Johnson purged himself of contempt.  Additionally, the Court required Johnson to pay the Commission attorneys fees for the time expended in seeking to enforce Johnsons compliance with the final judgment.  Finally, the Court imposed on Johnson a third-tier civil penalty of $120,000 for his failure to disclose his disciplinary history in filings with the Commission., After Johnson was arrested and incarcerated, the Court held a second show cause hearing.  Following this hearing, Judge Fish issued the December 9 Order, awarding the Commission additional monetary relief against Johnson.  The Court set the amount of the coercive fines against Johnson at $120,000.  Additionally, the Court granted the Commissions request for attorneys fees in the amount of $50,975., For further information regarding Marlen V.

Internet bulletin board.  The press release purported to announce that Extreme Networks, Inc. (Extreme Networks), a Santa Clara technology company, was acquiring Viasource Communications, Inc. (Viasource), a small Florida technology company.  The phony news caused Viasources stock price and volume to surge.  According to the SECs complaint, Sneiderman had purchased Viasource stock earlier that morning, and had hoped to profit from the price spike caused by his fraud.  However, within an hour after the false posting, Extreme Networks and Viasource denied the existence of a tender offer, and trading in both stocks was halted temporarily, preventing Sneiderman from capitalizing on his fraud.  , Sneiderman repeatedly failed to appear before the court.  In the January 13, 2003, order, the court found that the SECs complaint and evidence submitted by the SEC established Sneidermans liability for securities fraud.

The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York entered the final judgment against Ohlhauser. The judgment permanently enjoins Ohlhauser from violating Section 10A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by, among other things, failing to take the steps required by that section on detecting or otherwise becoming aware of information, during the course of auditing a public company, that an illegal act has or may have occurred.  Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations against him, Ohlhauser consented to the entry of the final judgment. , The Commissions complaint in this case, which was filed in December 1999 and amended in October 2000 and September 2001, charged Ohlhauser with failing to take appropriate action on discovering possible illegal conduct during an audit of Solucorps December 31, 1997 financial statements.  The Complaint, which also names Solucorp and certain of its current and former officers and directors as defendants, alleges that Solucorps management backdated a license agreement in order to cover-up Solucorps improper recognition during the quarter ended September 30, 1997 of $500,000 in license fees, or 40% of its revenues, and to materially overstate revenues for the six-month reporting period ended December 31, 1997.<b> </b>(<i>See</i> <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr16388.htm>Lit. Rel. No. 16388/December 13, 1999</a>)  The Complaint further alleges that, on being presented during the audit with the final license agreement, Ohlhauser reasonably concluded that the agreement appeared to have been backdated for improper accounting purposes.  He allegedly failed, however, to take the appropriate steps under Section 10A to determine, in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the likelihood that an illegal act had occurred, and to disclose, or assure the disclosure of, any illegal acts that he uncovered.  (<i>See</i> <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr16785.htm>Lit. Rel. No. 16785/October 31, 2000</a>)  The illegal acts at issue here included the commission of fraud by Solucorps president, who is alleged to have purposefully backdated the license agreement for purposes of supporting Solucorps improper revenue recognition.  , In a related proceeding, the Commission today issued an administrative order pursuant to Rule 102(e) of its Rules of Practice that denies Ohlhauser the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant, with a right to apply for reinstatement after two years.  In addition to finding that Ohlhauser has been permanently enjoined, as described above, the Commission finds in its Order that Ohlhauser engaged in improper professional conduct.  This is based on Ohlhausers failure to exercise professional skepticism and to gather competent evidential matter concerning the collectibility of license fees to afford a reasonable basis for the issuance of an unqualified audit report regarding Solucorps December 31, 1997 financial statements.  Ohlhauser, who admits to the Commissions finding that a final judgment was entered against him, but neither admits nor denies the second finding of improper professional conduct, consented to the entry of the administrative order against him.  <i>See</i> <i><a href=/litigation/admin/34-47256.htm>In the Matter of Glenn R.

Scott, U.S. District Judge for the Central District of Illinois, has found two former brokers and stock promoters, Wayne F. Gorsek (Gorsek) and Lyndell F. Parks (Parks) liable for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and has enjoined them from further violations of Sections 17(a) and (b) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.    Judge Scott  also imposed additional sanctions against defendants Gorsek, Parks and P. Brenden Gebben (Gebben), as set forth below.  , In a related proceeding, the Commission barred Gorsek and Parks from associating with a registered broker-dealer. Gorsek and Parks consented to the entry of the Commissions order barring them from association with any broker or dealer, without admitting or denying the Commissions findings against them.  , The Commissions Complaint, filed on January 7, 1999, alleged that defendants Gorsek, Parks, P. Brenden Gebben (Gebben) and Troy Justus (Justus) fraudulently promoted approximately 20 microcap companies through Strategic Investment Advisory, Inc. (SIA), a Springfield, Illinois-based company, in exchange for cash and securities. The Complaint alleged SIA deceived investors into believing that it was an independent securities research firm providing objective investment advice about undiscovered companies when, in fact, SIA was merely a paid promotional firm that uncritically published glowingly optimistic recommendations of the securities of its clients in exchange for cash and securities.  , The Complaint further alleged that at the same time defendants Gorsek and Parks engineered SIAs promotional scheme, they were co-owners and registered representatives at Strategic Investments, Inc. (SII) (a broker-dealer). The Complaint alleged that as registered representatives at SII, Gorsek and Parks defrauded brokerage customers by recommending the purchase of securities issued by SIA clients without disclosing that they received cash and securities from the issuers of those securities.

Moreover, at the close of evidence at trial, the Court directed a verdict in the Commissions favor, holding Gebben liable for violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 for fraudulently touting securities on the Internet.  The Court reserved decision on remedy issues for a subsequent remedy hearing.  See <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17352.htm>Litigation Release No. 17352</a> (February 5, 2002)., On April 17, 2002, Judge Scott, based on the Courts April 21, 2001 Summary Judgment Order, as well as Parks Consent, entered an Order of Final Judgment Against Parks that enjoined him from further violations of Sections 17(a) and (b) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.  The April 17, 2002, Order reserved for a subsequent remedy hearing the issue of the amount that Parks should pay in disgorgement, pre-judgment interest and civil penalties., On May 28, 2002, Judge Scott found, after a bench trial, that Gorsek, who was SIIs Compliance Officer and Supervisory Principal, as well as a broker at the firm, violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 by defrauding his brokerage customers at SII.   , On August 19, 2002, Judge Scott entered a Final Judgment of Permanent Injunction and Other Relief against Gorsek, restraining and enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The Courts Order (i) enjoined Gorsek from further violations of Sections 17(a) and (b) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, (ii) required Gorsek to pay $105,000 in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, $70,000 in prejudgment interest thereon, and a civil penalty in the amount of $75,000, and (iii) barred Gorsek from participating in any offering of a penny stock, including acting as a promoter, finder, consultant, agent, or other person who engages in activities with a broker, dealer or issuer for purposes of the issuance or trading in any penny stock, for a period of five years.  The Courts Order against Gorsek was based on the fraud findings set forth in the Courts Orders of May 28, 2002 and April 21, 2001, as well as Gorseks Consent to entry of the final judgment against him.   , Finally, on September 9, 2002, Judge Scott entered an Order of Final Judgment against Parks and Gebben, following a remedy hearing.  The Court ordered Parks to pay $105,000 in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, pre-judgment interest of $35,000, and a civil penalty of $10,000 (based, in part, on his inability to pay).

The complaint charges the firm and four partners with fraud, and seeks injunctions, disgorgement of all fees and civil money penalties.  , The complaint alleges that KPMG and its partners permitted Xerox to manipulate its accounting practices to close a $3 billion gap between actual operating results and results reported to the investing public.  Year after year, the defendants falsely represented to the public that their audits were conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS) and that Xeroxs financial reports fairly represented the companys financial condition and were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  , The four partners named as defendants, all of whom are certified public accountants, are:, The Commissions complaint alleges that beginning at least as early as 1997, Xerox initiated or increased reliance on various accounting devices to manipulate its equipment revenues and earnings.  Most of these topside accounting devices violated GAAP and most improperly increased the amount of equipment revenue from leased office equipment products which Xerox recognized in its quarterly and annual financial statements filed with the Commission and distributed to investors and the public.  This improper revenue recognition had the effect of inflating equipment revenues and earnings beyond what actual operating results warranted.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants fraudulently permitted Xerox to manipulate reserves to boost the companys earnings., The complaint alleges that under GAAP, when lessors such as Xerox enter into a sales type lease they must recognize immediately nearly all of the revenue attributed to the value of the product, but must spread recognition of financing, servicing and supply revenues over the life of the lease.  Traditionally, Xerox local offices in each country booked the value of leased products at the time a lease was entered into, accounting also for the cost of financing and servicing the equipment during the lease period, based on local market conditions.  Beginning in at least 1997, Xerox altered its accounting to treat more finance and servicing revenue as part of the value of the equipment, allowing Xerox to recognize a greater portion of revenue from new leases immediately in its financial statements.  These calculations were made either by management at Stamford or by local country managers based on explicit assumptions dictated by Stamford, which ignored local economic conditions.  The complaint refers to these new methods as topside accounting devices imposed by senior Xerox financial managers.  Xerox told KPMG it needed to resort to these improper accounting devices because it could no longer rely on the traditional way it established the fair value of its products., Although adoption of these new methods made Xerox revenue and earnings reports not comparable to earlier periods, and resulted in less revenue and earnings for reporting in future periods, Xerox never informed the public of the changes., According to the complaint, KPMG affiliate offices in Europe, Brazil, Canada and Japan, as well as KPMG auditors at Xeroxs main U.S. operations facility in Rochester, N.Y., repeatedly warned the defendant KPMG partners, who had overall responsibility for the Xerox audit engagement, that manipulative actions taken by Xerox to improve revenues and earnings were unnecessary, were not adequately tested, and distorted true business results.  The defendant KPMG partners, who worked near Xerox headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut or at KPMGs New York headquarters, gave little weight to these warnings from on-the-scene KPMG affiliates and did not demand that Xerox justify the reasons for departures from historic accounting methods or establish the accuracy of the new, manipulative practices.    , The warnings provided to the defendant KPMG partners from KPMG affiliate offices included the following:, Although the defendants occasionally voiced concern to Xerox management about the topside accounting devices developed and manipulated by senior corporate financial managers to increase revenue and earnings, the defendants did little or nothing when Xerox ignored their concerns and continued manipulating its financial results.  The defendants then knowingly or recklessly set aside their reservations, failed in their professional duties as auditors, and gave a clean bill of health to Xeroxs financial statements.  Rather than put at risk a lucrative financial relationship with a premier client, the defendants failed to challenge Xeroxs improper accounting actions and make the company accurately report its financial results.  , After this fraudulent conduct was investigated and exposed, Xerox, employing a new auditor, issued a $6.1 billion restatement of its equipment revenues and a $1.9 billion restatement of its pre-tax earnings for the years 1997 through 2000.  The Commissions complaint alleges that the defendants fraudulent conduct allowed Xerox to inflate equipment revenues by approximately $3 billion and inflate pre-tax earnings by approximately $1.2 billion in the companys 1997 through 2000 financial results., The Complaint alleges that each defendant violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 10A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and aided and abetted violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rules 13a-1, 13a-13, 12b-20 and 13b2-1., On April 11, 2002, the Commission brought an injunctive action against Xerox based on the same allegations of accounting fraud as are alleged against the KPMG defendants, as well as other allegations.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Xerox consented to the entry of a Final Judgment that permanently enjoined the company from violating the antifraud, reporting and record keeping provisions of the federal securities laws.  Xerox also paid a $10 million civil penalty, agreed to restate its financial statements and agreed to hire a consultant to review the companys internal accounting controls and policies.  <i>Securities and Exchange Commission v.

In addition to being permanently enjoined from future violations of the federal securities laws, Capalbo was ordered to pay over $19 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and penalties.  , The Commission filed its action against Capalbo and eight other defendants and a relief defendant on April 1, 2002, alleging that individuals associated with an entity known as Brite Business Corporation made fraudulent representations to investors, promising exorbitant returns through a high yield trading program.  According to the Commissions complaint, most of the Brite Business investor funds were maintained in a brokerage account at the Cranston, Rhode Island office of Raymond James Financial Services, where Capalbos husband, Dennis Herula, worked as a broker.  The complaint alleges that, between 1999 and 2001, Capalbo, Herula and others associated with Brite Business misappropriated, transferred or lost approximately $20 million in investor funds.    , On April 3, 2002, the federal court in Rhode Island entered a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against Capalbo, and on May 8, 2002, the court entered a written preliminary injunction against her.  The court entered the final judgment by default against Capalbo on January 27, 2003, permanently enjoining her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws [Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder].  Capalbo was also ordered to pay disgorgement of $16,708,520.83, plus prejudgment interest of $2,583,581.31, for total disgorgement liability of $19,292,102.14.  She was also assessed a $250,000 civil monetary penalty.  , In its memorandum and order, the court found that Capalbo used her status as an attorney to perpetrate fraud against investors.  According to the court, Capalbo allowed her status as an attorney to be used to attract investor funds, lied to investors about the status of their funds, and then spent investor money on luxury items for herself, such as jewelry, art, cars, and trips.  The court found a permanent injunction against Capalbo necessary, stating that, based on her conduct in this matter, future violations by her are all but certain.  , For further information, please see Litigation Release Numbers <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17800.htm>17800</a> (October 23, 2002) [final judgment against Dennis Herula]; <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17514.htm>17514</a> (May 13, 2002) [preliminary injunction and asset freeze against Capalbo, Herula and others]; <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17461.htm>17461</a> (April 5, 2002) [temporary restraining order and asset freeze against Capalbo, Herula and others].,  , <!--<P><IMG SRC=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=9 ALT= BORDER=0>  <A href=/litigation/complaints/comp17957.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</A></P>--><i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17957.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The next day, after Sepracor publicly announced the termination of the license agreement, he sold them, profiting by $55,172.  According to the Commissions complaint, on April 18, 2001, George Potter transferred approximately the same amount --$55,000 -- to Timothy Potters account.  , The Commissions complaint alleges that Timothy Potter, a manager in Sepracors accounting department, learned no later than October 18, 2000, that Eli Lilly and Company might terminate a license agreement with Sepracor concerning the development of a new version of Lillys top-selling antidepressant, Prozac.  According to the complaint, on October 18, Timothy Potter tipped his father about the potential termination, in breach of a duty he owed to Sepracor and its shareholders not to trade, or direct others to trade, in the companys securities while in possession of material, nonpublic information about the company.  The Commissions complaint further alleges that George Potter, acting on the tip, purchased put options on Sepracor stock for $30,694 - in effect, betting that the price of Sepracor stock would fall., As a result of the conduct described in the complaint, the Commission charged George Potter and Timothy Potter with securities fraud in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, based on their illegal insider trading.  The Commissions complaint seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of the profits from their insider trading, plus prejudgment interest, and a civil monetary penalty of up to three times the amount of the profits from their insider trading.    , The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Chicago Board Options Exchange in the matter.,  , , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp17958.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>]"

Preska of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a Final Judgment against defendant Allen B. Gottlieb and relief defendants Americredit Commercial Corporation, Law Offices of Gottlieb and Associates, P.C. , and Finanzurich, Limited.  Two other defendants, Kenneth R. Lagonia and Patrick J. Madden were found not liable for the charges filed against them in this case.  , The Court found that Allen Gottlieb violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and permanently enjoined him from future violations.  The Court also ordered Gottlieb to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling $2,005,443 and civil money penalties of $878,333.  The Court ordered the relief defendants to pay more than $1.8 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest.  , After a four day bench trial in early December 2002, the Court found that Gottlieb made numerous material misrepresentations in connection with his promotion of a fraudulent investment program that featured so-called prime bank instruments that were purportedly traded by the worlds largest banks on a secretive international market.  In connection with the scheme, three investors lost nearly $1.8 million in two separate transactions.  In holding Gottlieb liable, Judge Preska noted that Gottlieb misrepresented his experience in dealing with prime bank instruments; misrepresented the financial capabilities of a bank that was to facilitate the prime bank trading; and omitted to tell the investors about prior failed transactions in which he played a similar role.  , The Court further found, citing expert witness testimony offered by the Commission, that the investments Gottlieb promoted were nothing other than bogus attempts to make money.  Among other things, the Commissions expert witness identified the similarities between Gottliebs scheme and numerous other prime bank frauds that recently have emerged and remain a persistent hazard to unwary investors., For more information about this matter, see Litigation Release Nos. 15705 (April 14, 1998);  15752 (May 21, 1998); 16207 (July 12, 1999); 15819 (July 23, 1998). , For more information about prime bank frauds, see the SECs homepage at http:// www.sec.gov/enforce/pbank/pbnkhome.htm., , <!-- <P><IMG SRC=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=9 ALT= BORDER=0>  <A href=/litigation/complaints/comp17960.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</A></P> --><i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17960.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Final Judgment orders him to disgorge $1,370,646., On April 18, 2001, the Commission initiated this action by filing a Complaint for Injunctive and Other Relief against Sunstate, and three principal officers, Ulrich Garbe, Peggy Patterson and John Hyland.  The Commission also filed a Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Other Emergency Relief, including an asset freeze (TRO Motion).  In addition, the Commission requested the appointment of a receiver over Sunstate.  The Court granted the TRO Motion, issued a temporary restraining order barring the Defendants from violating the federal securities laws, froze their assets, and appointed a receiver.

In reality, the Defendants traded only a fraction of the $54 million.

The complaint alleged that Humesky, Rodd, and Broege made material misrepresentations and omissions while selling investments in pay telephones.  Humesky, Rodd, and Broege represented to potential investors that they had investigated LinkTel and that it was a profitable company.  The complaint further alleged that LinkTel was, in fact, an insolvent ponzi scheme and that defendants did not reasonably investigate LinkTels financial status.  The defendants also distributed sales materials that misrepresented that their commissions would be 15%.  In fact, defendants received commissions ranging between 20% and 22%.

D/B/A AGS, INC., ET AL., Defendants</u>, Civil Action No. 3:02-CV-606-L, <b><u>SEC OBTAINS $1.9 MILLION JUDGMENT IN CONNECTION WITH FRAUDULENT INTERNATIONAL GOLD TRADING SCHEME.</u></b>, On January 16, 2003, in an enforcement action filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division, entered judgment against Godfried Martin Sarpong and his company, Africa Gemstone Corporation, for violating the antifraud and securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws.  Sarpong is a citizen of the Republic of Ghana, who resides in London, and Africa Gemstone is a Ghanaian corporation with offices in London and Accra, Republic of Ghana., The court ordered Sarpong and Africa Gemstone, jointly and severally, to disgorge unjust profits of $1,105,621, plus prejudgment interest of $73,632.59, and the court ordered Sarpong and Africa Gemstone to pay civil money penalties of $120,000 and $600,000, respectively.  The total monetary relief ordered by the court was $1,899,254.  The court also enjoined Sarpong and Africa Gemstone from offering or selling unregistered securities in violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, and from committing securities fraud, in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  , The SEC filed the case on March 22, 2002, charging Sarpong, Africa Gemstone and others with selling unregistered securities and misleading investors in connection with an international gold trading deal.  According to the Complaint, between February 2000 and January 2001, the defendants raised over $1.3 million by offering and selling unregistered promissory notes to investors in several states.  The SEC alleged that the defendants assured investors they could liquidate their principal upon thirty days notice; promised investors returns of five percent to ten percent per month (i.e., 60-120% per annum); and promised to earn those returns by using the investors money to buy gold bullion in Ghana and sell it in England at a 12% profit.  The SEC further alleged that the defendants told investors that the risk of the investment was minimal, because of built-in safety factors, such as oversight by the government of Ghana and verification of the investment by the defendants.  In fact, according to the Complaint, those safeguards did not exist, and Sarpong, operating through Africa Gemstone, inflicted substantial losses by stealing much of the investors money.  , The SEC further alleged that, although Sarpong agreed to trade gold for the other defendants on an ongoing basis - continually returning any sale proceeds to Ghana to purchase more gold - he instead diverted more than half of the sale proceeds (over $750,000) to his personal bank account.  The SEC also alleged that Sarpong stole two gold shipments valued at approximately $250,000.  As a result of Sarpongs thefts, the investment was never profitable, and never earned sufficient profits to be able to pay the investors the returns the defendants promised., The Commissions complaint charged that Africa Gemstone and Sarpong, along with their associates, Mark Tuley of Abilene, Texas, Ardis Gaither and John Temple of Sweetwater, Texas, and Big Country AGS, Inc. (AGS), a Texas corporation based in Sweetwater, directly or indirectly sold unregistered securities, in violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933; and committed securities fraud, in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In its Complaint, the Commission requested that the defendants be enjoined from future securities violations and be ordered to disgorge their illegal profits and pay civil money penalties., Simultaneously with the filing of its action, the Commission accepted an offer of settlement from AGS, Gaither, Temple and Tuley, in which those defendants agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions Complaint, to the entry of an order enjoining them from further violations of the securities laws; to pay civil money penalties of $20,000 each; and to pay disgorgement of $200,000 in illegal profits, plus $22,840 in prejudgment interest.  AGS, Gaither, Temple and Tuley also agreed to pay the costs of disbursing the disgorged profits and prejudgment interest to the <i>bona fide</i> holders of AGS promissory notes on a <i>pro rata</i> basis.  Despite their agreement to those terms, AGS, Gaither, Temple and Tuley have, to date, refused to pay any of the agreed amounts, and the SEC has filed contempt proceedings in an effort to enforce the terms of the settlement.<!--<pre></pre><table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5><tr><td><IMG SRC=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=9 ALT=*  BORDER=0 ALIGN=absmiddle>&nbsp;</td><td><a href=/litigation/complaints/complr17967.htm>SEC Complaint</a> in this matter.</td></tr></table>-->]"

The indictment further alleges that, on or about October 18, Potter disclosed the material, nonpublic information to a co-conspirator, who used the information to purchase Sepracor put options and made an overnight profit of $55,313 when he sold the options the next day following Sepracors public announcement of the termination.

(Clearnet) would be acquired by the Telus Corporation (Telus).  , The Commissions Complaint alleges that, in August 2000, the Watsons went on a family vacation with relatives.  According to the Complaint, on August 10, 2000, these relatives told the Watsons about an impending, non-public, friendly tender offer by Telus for the stock of Clearnet.  The Complaint alleges that the relatives disclosed the information to the Watsons in the context of confiding their anxiety about its effect on the job of one of the relatives as a Telus executive.  The Complaint further alleges that on August 11, the very next day, while still on vacation, Linda Watson purchased 3,300 shares of Clearnet.

Cal.)  , The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles yesterday alleging securities fraud perpetrated primarily against Armenian-Americans by Michael Garian, also known as Melkon Gharakhanian, and his company, National Investment Enterprises (NIE).    , The SECs complaint alleges that between 1997 and mid-2001, Garian, 41, of Van Nuys, California, and Glendale-based NIE raised over $19 million from about 200 investors.  Most of the investors Garian and NIE targeted were residents of Glendales large Armenian-American community, many of whom had never invested in the stock market, and some of whom were Armenian immigrants for whom English was a second language.  Garian allegedly falsely told investors that he would use their money to purchase various securities for their accounts; had an inside line to upcoming hot IPOs, particularly for Internet and other technology-related companies; and could deliver large profits quickly.  The complaint charges that Garian and NIE furthered their scheme by sending investors false monthly account statements that represented that NIE was purchasing large volumes of IPO shares and other securities on their behalf and making large profits from Garians trading activities.  , In fact, Garian invested only $5.2 million of the $19 million he raised, of which Garian lost all but $1.6 million in IPO investments, day trading, and commodities trading.  The bulk of the investors funds, $14 million, was used to repay earlier investors their principal and purported investment returns in order to sustain a Ponzi-like scheme.  Garian used at least $112,000 for his own personal benefit, and an additional $2.3 million was withdrawn from NIEs bank account in the form of cashiers checks which remain unaccounted for, the complaint alleges.  NIEs investors ultimately sustained a loss of approximately $5 million.  , Concurrent with the filing of its complaint against Garian and NIE, the SEC also announced that it reached a settlement with relief defendant Aegis Financial, LLC, a Chicago-based commodities broker.  The SEC did not charge Aegis with securities law violations, but instead named it as a relief defendant in order to require Aegis to return $210,000 of investors funds that had been loaned by Garian and NIE.  Aegis promised to deposit the $210,000 into the Courts registry.  , The SECs complaint alleges that Garians and NIEs conduct violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10b of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and that NIE separately violated Section 7(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

(Rocky Mountain), a brokerage firm headquartered in Denver, and Judith L. Clarke, a Denver resident and former employee of Rocky Mountain.  Rocky Mountain ceased business on February 3, 2003, due to a multi-million dollar net capital deficiency.  The Commission alleged that Rocky Mountain violated the net capital and customer protection provisions of the federal securities laws contained in Section 15(c)(3)(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 15c3-1 and 15c3-3.  The Commission also alleged that Rocky Mountain violated the broker-dealer books and record provisions of the Exchange Act contained in Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-3.  In this action, the Commission sought a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against the firm, as well as preliminary and permanent injunctions.  In addition, the Commission filed a joint motion with the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), which filed a separate action, to have a trustee appointed to liquidate the firm., In the action the Commission also charged Clarke with aiding and abetting Rocky Mountains violations of the net capital, customer protection and books and records provisions.  The Commission also charged Clarke with violating the antifraud provisions of the Exchange Act contained in Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5.  The Commission alleged that Clarke had traded equities for Rocky Mountain in an account at the firm and allegedly incurred significant trading losses, which she attempted to conceal from the firm by creating false trading records.  To pay the debts owed by Rocky Mountain as the result of the losses, Clarke allegedly used almost the entire $4.5 million balance of a money market account in Rocky Mountains name.  This money market account had contained cash belonging to Rocky Mountains retail customers.  The Commission sought against Clarke a temporary restraining order, asset freeze and an order to provide an accounting, as well as preliminary and permanent injunctions, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest and civil penalties., On February 7, 2003, a temporary restraining order was entered against Rocky Mountain prohibiting the firm from violating the net capital, customer protection and broker-dealer books and records provisions the firm was alleged to have violated in the complaint.

Zloch, Chief United States District Judge for the Southern District of Florida, entered a temporary restraining order against the promoters of a series of local telephone company partnerships.  The Commissions complaint and request for emergency relief, filed on February 7, 2003, in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, alleges Marc David Shiner, a convicted felon, and others defrauded hundreds of investors nationwide through the sale of unregistered securities in six limited liability partnerships (LLPs) that were ostensibly formed to operate competitive local telephone exchange carriers (CLECs) in Western states where Qwest Communications was the dominant local telephone carrier., The Commissions complaint names four primary defendants.  Specifically, as alleged in the complaint:   , , , , , The Commissions complaint also names four relief defendants.  Specifically, as alleged in the complaint:   , , , , , According to the complaint, since at least February 2001 and continuing through the present, the primary defendants raised in excess of $7.6 million in an elaborate scheme involving a series of interlocking companies that they secretly controlled, siphoning off the vast majority of funds raised for their own use, instead of using the proceeds to fund the underlying partnerships.  Defendants Shiner and Swichkow used boiler room tactics at defendant Telecom Advisory, an unregistered broker-dealer, to market the LLPs to unsuspecting investors.  According to the complaint, the defendants made numerous material misrepresentations and omissions, including (1) providing unrealistic and baseless projections for rates of return and potential buyout offers, (2) failing to disclose that the majority of the invested funds were used to pay exorbitant commissions and management fees to entities controlled by the Defendants, including the Relief Defendants herein, (3) failing to disclose the interlocking relationships of the entities and individuals involved, (4) failing to disclose that certain of the non-voting units would be sold before the voting units had recouped their original investment from the profits of the telephone company, (5) failing to disclose the negative regulatory histories of defendants Shiner, Swichkow and Wetherald, and (6) failing to disclose that neither Mile High Telecom, nor any of the other phone companies they established, were properly licensed to operate in the respective states they purported to serve . , The six LLPs marketed by the defendants are:  (1) Mile High Telecom Partners, LLP;  (2) Phone Company of Arizona, LLP; (3) Washington Phone Company, LLP; (4) Minnesota Phone Company Financial Group, LLP; (5) Iowa-Nebraska Phone Company, LLP; and (6) Oregon Phone Company Financial Group, LLP.  According to the complaint, only one of the CLECs, Mile High Telecom in Colorado, had any significant, albeit negative, operating history.  Investors were induced to purchase units in other LLPs by being repeatedly told that On Systems, and defendant Wetherald had extensive expertise in operating telecommunications companies, and that Mile High Telecoms customer base was growing substantially due to On Systems and Wetheralds successful management.  In fact, according to the complaint, Mile High Telecom was in trouble financially and never returned any investors initial investment.  , The Commissions complaint charges that Shiner, Swichkow and Telecom Advisory Services violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 15(a) and 15(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint further alleges that Wetherald violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.  , The complaint seeks, among other things, a temporary restraining order that prohibits the primary defendants from accepting funds from actual or potential investors, requires them to provide sworn accountings, and enjoins them from further violations of the securities laws referenced above., The complaint does not charge the relief defendants with substantive violations of the federal securities laws.  Rather, because they each received investor funds as a result of the primary defendants misconduct, the Commission seeks to freeze their assets for eventual return to investors., The Commission has previously sued Shiner for securities fraud.

As a result, The North Face overstated its revenue and gross margin recognition by fraudulently recognizing revenue on barter transactions and by fraudulently recording consignment sales as completed, regular sales.  Crawford, Katz, and Tyrer tried to conceal the true nature of the improperly reported transactions from The North Faces auditors and from a special audit committee investigation.  Crawford made material misrepresentations and omissions to the auditors in an attempt to hide his misconduct.  Katz and Tyrer also conspired to keep their fraud from being discovered.  They persuaded a customer of the company, Marcus, to lie to the internal investigators and senior management, and to sign false documents, knowing that the information would be relied upon by the auditors.

Beginning in July 1997, according to the evidence, Callipari was working as a trader for JAS Securities, a New York city broker-dealer firm.  Callipari allowed a co-conspirator, Thomas J. Connolly, a Fidelity trader,<b> </b>to trade in index options on the Chicago Board of Options Exchange for the benefit of Calliparis JAS account, even though JAS had no account at Fidelity and Connolly was not authorized to make such trades.  , Between July and early September 1997, Connolly made successful trades for Callipari, earning $500,000 in profits.  Callipari received about $220,000 of those profits.  In mid-September, however, Connollys trading turned negative, resulting in about $2.39 million in losses.  Callipari tried to reject all of the losing trades, telling traders at the Chicago Board that he had not authorized them, and, as a result, Fidelity ended up incurring all of the $2.39 million in losses.   , The statutory maximum prison sentence for each count is five years in federal prison. The conspiracy and wire fraud counts also carry fines of up to $250,000 or twice the amount of gain or loss.  The obstruction count carries a maximum fine of $250,000.   , The case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Boston, with assistance from the Securities and Exchange Commission. <!--<IMG SRC=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=9 ALT= BORDER=0>  <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp17980.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>--><!-- End text -->,  ]"

Hoover, age 54, and his two wholly owned entities, Hoover Capital Management, Inc. (HCM), formerly a registered investment adviser, and Chestnut Management LLC, an unregistered investment adviser.  , In its complaint, the Commission alleged that between 1995 and 2001, Hoover misappropriated funds from investment advisory clients, including the Chestnut Fund LP, a hedge fund founded and managed by Hoover.  The Commission also alleged that Hoover solicited and obtained investments in the hedge fund by making fraudulent misrepresentations to prospective investors, and that Hoover attempted to conceal his misappropriations by distributing fictitious account statements to investors.  , Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Hoover and his entities consented to a final judgment ordering them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,011,007.48.  The defendants also agreed to entry of injunctions that permanently enjoin them from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act).

Haggard, Jr. for issuing materially misleading press releases concerning the purported acquisition of a multi-million dollar loan portfolio, Autofunds 2001 revenues, and the approval of a $2 million loan.  Until ceasing business operations in June 2002, Autofund, based in San Antonio, was engaged in the business of collecting charged-off automobile loans.  Autofunds stock was quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol AFSR.  , The Commission alleged that on January 22, 2002, Autofund issued a press release announcing that it had completed the closure of an automobile loan portfolio with a $30 million face value.   In fact, Autofund had never acquired this portfolio.  On January 23, 2002, Autofund announced that its 2001 revenues increased 24% from the previous year, when, in fact, its revenues had actually declined approximately 11%.  Finally, on March 5 and 7, 2002, Autofund announced that it had secured a $2 million loan that would allow the company to acquire loan portfolios that would lead to significant increases in earnings.  In fact, Autofund had not obtained any such loan.  , Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SECs complaint, Autofund and Haggard have consented to the entry of an injunction for violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Named in the Commissions complaint were Kenneth W. Mellert of Naperville, Illinois, at the time a Regional Sales Director in PeopleSofts Chicago-area office, and Roman D. Mayer of Atlanta, Georgia.  Simultaneous with the filing of the Commissions complaint, and without admitting or denying the allegations, Mayer consented to a court order enjoining him from future violations of the securities laws and ordering him to pay disgorgement and penalties.  The Commissions litigation against Mellert is ongoing., The complaint alleges that on April 1, 2002, Mellert learned that PeopleSoft, a San Francisco Bay Area software company, would be preannouncing an earnings shortfall at the end of the day.  According to the complaint, Mellert called Mayer, and the two agreed that Mayer would purchase $16,000 in PeopleSoft put options - securities that would rise in value if the Companys stock price fell.  Immediately after Mellerts phone call, Mayer called his broker and purchased the options.  , Following the close of the market on April 1, PeopleSoft issued a press release announcing that its revenue for the quarter would fall short of analyst expectations.  The press release caused the companys stock price to plunge by 33% the next day.  Several days later, Mayer sold the put options, netting a profit of $218,173.  According to the Commissions complaint, Mayer kept sufficient funds to pay taxes on his trading proceeds, and split the remaining funds with Mellert, paying him approximately $59,000., The Commissions action charges Mellert and Mayer with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement, and civil monetary penalties.  The Commission has accepted Mayers offer of settlement in which he consents, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, to an injunction against future violations of these provisions, and agrees to pay approximately $161,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and approximately $109,000 in penalties.  ,  , <!--<P><IMG SRC=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=9 ALT= BORDER=0>  <A href=/litigation/complaints/comp17983.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</A></P>--><i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17983.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

As part of the judgment, he was ordered to pay a civil penalty of $40,000 and barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.,  The Commission alleged in its complaint that the hidden loan losses had a material impact on the parent company -- Surety Capitals financial statements that were included in its Forms 10-K and Forms10-Q from 1996 through 1999. Further, the Commission alleged that, because of the misstatements, Surety Capital failed to make and keep books, records and accounts that accurately reflected its transactions and dispositions of assets, and also failed to maintain an adequate system of internal financial controls., The Courts judgment permanently enjoins Heinzelmann from violating Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and aiding or abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  , See also, Litigation Releases No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17491.htm>17491</a> (April 25, 2002), No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17788.htm>17788</a> (October 16, 2002),  and No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17589.htm>17589</a> (June 27, 2002)., ,  , <!--<P><IMG SRC=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=9 ALT= BORDER=0>  <A href=/litigation/complaints/comp17984.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</A></P>--><i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17984.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

In return for compensation from stock promoters and issuers, Meltzer sent millions of unsolicited emails and created numerous websites to promote various penny stocks.  In order to conceal his identity - and to avoid the detection of web hosts seeking to stop Internet spam - Meltzer operated under at least thirty different assumed Internet identities., The SECs Complaint alleges that Meltzers spam and websites made false and misleading representations about the stock he helped to promote.  First, Meltzer falsely stated that his recommendations represented his own investment opinions based on his review of the issuers public filings and his interviews with the issuers management.  In fact, Meltzer did not review the issuers filings, did not interview their management, and simply republished recommendations and representations that he received from the promoters who had hired him.  Second, in his emails and websites, Meltzer knowingly or recklessly made false and misleading representations concerning the issuers current business and projections of future performance that had no reasonable basis in fact.

The indictment, premised upon conduct identified in a Commission civil action, alleged that between January 1997 and Oct. 12, 2001, Dillies company, Mid-America Foundation, Inc., fraudulently raised at least $52.9 million through the sale of Charitable Gift Annuities; he had represented to investors that their funds would go into stocks, bonds and money market accounts.  Dillie is accused of diverting $19.2 million of the monies raised to a hidden account that afforded him a luxurious lifestyle, including gambling away at least $10.2 million in Las Vegas, buying a $1.6 million Las Vegas home and a $52,000 Mercedes-Benz.  Besides gambling money away, Dillie also wrote himself checks for over $600,000.  To keep the Ponzi scheme running, the indictment further alleges, Dillie used $7.9 million of investors money to pay earlier investors and spent $3 million in commissions to sales agents.  When the plan collapsed in October 2001, Dillie told investors that Mid-America had disbanded due to inadequate assets. , Previously, on December 20, 2001, the Commission brought emergency litigation before Judge James A.

February 21, 2003), <p align=CENTER>SEC FILES FRAUD ACTION AGAINST DOUGLAS NORMAN, <br/>FOUNDER OF WORLD TRANSPORT AUTHORITY, INC. , The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Douglas Norman, the self-described founder and de facto chief executive of World Transport Authority, Inc. (WTA).  According to the Complaint, WTA, a Canadian corporation headquartered in the San Diego area, claims to have designed a revolutionary car, called the WorldStar, and a unique system for manufacturing the car, called a micro-factory, which can be set up in 90 days and thereafter produce a single car per day.  The Complaint alleges that beginning no later than calendar year 2000, and continuing into 2001, Norman knew of and approved materially false or misleading press releases issued by WTA, made or knowingly permitted the posting of materially false or misleading statements on the Internet, failed to file required reports concerning his beneficial ownership and holdings of WTA stock, and permitted WTA to file materially false or misleading quarterly and annual reports with the Commission.  Also, the Complaint alleges that during the period when the false or misleading statements were being made, Norman sold, at inflated prices, at least 5.5 million shares of WTA stock without registration, realizing at least $1.8 million from the sales., The Complaint alleges, among other things, that in the year 2000 and into 2001, WTA issued numerous materially false or misleading press releases and other statements concerning licenses for production of the WorldStar in underdeveloped countries and regions, and revenue expected from the license deals.  In September 2000, for example, WTA announced the issuance of the license for China for $40 million, and projected revenues from the license over three years at $900 million.  The Complaint alleges that Norman knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that there was no reasonable basis for the revenue projection, and that the statement concerning the license price was also materially false or misleading., The U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York, on the same day, announced that an indictment had been handed up against Norman charging one count of securities fraud.  , In its Complaint, the Commission requests that the Court issue a final judgment of permanent injunction and other relief against Norman based upon violations he committed, or for which he is liable as a controlling person of WTA, of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(d), and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13d-1, and 16a-3.  The Commission also is seeking an order that Norman be prohibited from acting as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in any offering of penny stock, that he provide an accounting, that he disgorge, with prejudgment interest, certain trading profits and other remuneration, and that he pay civil penalties under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act., The Commissions investigation in this matter is continuing., <p align=CENTER>* * *, The Commission is cooperating with a separate investigation in this matter carried on by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York., The Commission staff acknowledges the assistance of NASD in connection with this matter.  , For tips on how to avoid Internet pump-and-dump stock manipulation schemes, visit <a href=/investor/online/pump.htm>http://www.sec.gov/investor/online/pump.htm</a>., For more information about Internet fraud, visit <a href=/divisions/enforce/internetenforce.htm target=_top>http://www.sec.gov/divisions/enforce/internetenforce.htm</a>., To report suspicious activity involving possible Internet fraud, visit <a href=/complaint.shtml> http://www.sec.gov/complaint.shtml</a>.,  , , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp17993.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>]"

According to the indictment, Jung was the sole manager of the Strategic Income Fund and the controlling general partner of ETJ Partners, Ltd., a broker-dealer through which Jung traded stock options on the Chicago Board Options Exchange.  The indictment charges Jung with eight counts of wire fraud and two counts of securities fraud in connection with a fraudulent scheme that caused approximately 55 investors to lose more than $21 million., The indictment alleges that from July 1994 to September, 1998, Jung engaged in a fraudulent scheme in which he falsely represented to prospective investors and investors that their pledged securities and cash would be used solely to conduct stock options trading on behalf of the Strategic Income Fund.  Instead, Jung misappropriated the investors assets to collateralize his own securities trading and other securities trading unrelated to the Strategic Income Fund.  Beginning no later than January 1995, Jung also misappropriated pledged securities and cash for other purposes, including to pay expenses of ETJ Partners, such as lease fees for its seat on the CBOE.  In addition, the indictment alleges that Jung misrepresented his trading performance record to prospective investors by distributing written trading track records that inflated the success of his trading for the fund and failed to disclose the adverse financial impact of his misappropriations.  Jung also distributed false quarterly statements to investors to retain their investments and to lull them into a false sense of security.  The values of the investors accounts were falsely stated because they failed to reflect any reduction in value caused by the misappropriation., On June 19, 2001, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil complaint against Jung and ETJ Partners in connection with the scheme described above.  The Commissions complaint charged that Jung and his broker-dealer, ETJ Partners, violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  On March 14, 2002, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered a final judgment order against Jung and ETJ Partners, pursuant to their consent, which enjoined Jung and ETJ Partners from future violations of the above antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  In addition, on March 28, 2002, the Commission entered an order in an administrative proceeding filed against Jung and ETJ Partners which barred Jung from association with any broker or dealer or investment adviser and which revoked ETJ Partners registration with the Commission as a broker-dealer.

When Qwest and Global Business determined that Qwest was falling short of its quarterly revenue targets and would not achieve the projected growth for the quarters ending June 30, 2001, and September 30, 2000, the defendants bridged the revenue gap by fraudulently mischaracterizing these transactions.<sup> </sup> , The Commissions complaint alleges the following:, The Commissions complaint seeks an order against all defendants enjoining them from further violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder and for their aiding and abetting violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13; imposing civil money penalties; and ordering disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains, including any compensation, bonuses, or stock trading profits made during their fraudulent activities.

The complaint also named as defendants Investment Recovery Network, Inc. (Investment Recovery), a Florida corporation Magnan controlled, Old Dominion Securities, Inc. (Old Dominion), a Florida-based broker-dealer and John DelPrince (DelPrince), Old Dominions founder and principal., The Commissions complaint, filed in federal district court in Tampa, alleges that beginning in 1999, Magnan and Investment Recovery fraudulently raised more than $3 million in several unregistered offerings of Investment Recovery stock.  In connection with the offering of Investment Recovery stock, Magnan and Investment Recovery failed to disclose Magnans regulatory and criminal background, disseminated written offering materials that contained financial projections that lacked a reasonable basis, made baseless predictions about the future price of Investment Recoverys stock, and led investors to believe that Investment Recovery would sell its shares to the public through an IPO within a specified period of time at a certain price.  Many of these misrepresentations were strikingly similar to the fraudulent conduct detailed in the Commissions 1995 Order that barred Magnan from associating with any broker or dealer., The complaint also alleges that from June 2000 to at least December 2000, Magnan retained Old Dominion, and two of its associated persons, including DelPrince, to sell stock in Investment Recoverys offerings.  Magnans relationship with Old Dominion violated the terms of the Commissions 1995 Order because he essentially controlled the operations of Old Dominions office in Tampa, Florida., The Commissions complaint seeks a permanent injunction against Magnan and  Investment Recovery based on their violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Magnans additional violation of Section 15(b)(6)(B)(i) of the Exchange Act (which prohibits an individual barred by the Commission from becoming associated with a broker or dealer absent the Commissions consent).

According to the complaint, Horne never informed anyone at Watts of his trading, which violated a Watts written policy prohibiting trading in any companys securities on the basis of nonpublic information.

Dowdell has previously pled guilty to criminal charges of securities fraud, wire fraud and money laundering stemming from this scheme, and is awaiting sentencing., The judgment requires Vavasseur to pay disgorgement of $121,235,000, plus $8,611,214.42 in prejudgment interest.  The court also imposed a $600,000 civil penalty, issued a permanent injunction prohibiting future violations of the federal securities laws and, in a separate order, appointed Roy M. Terry Jr. and the law firm of DurretteBradshaw PLC as Receiver over the corporations assets.  Additionally, the Court ordered Vavasseur to repatriate millions of dollars of investor funds located in bank accounts in Ireland, Belgium, Guernsey and Mexico., The SECs enforcement action arises out of a fictitious investment program that Dowdell operated through Vavasseur Corporation, a Bahamian company controlled by Dowdell.  According to the 20 Count Information filed in the District Court, investors in this program (the Vavasseur Program) were required to sign an investment contract with Vavasseur, termed a Discretionary Investment Management Agreement (Agreement).

In connection with this order, more than $23 million of funds directly traced to Vavasseur investors has been frozen in various U.S. banks, including the AmSouth Bank, the Bank of America and The Chase Manhattan Bank., On June 4, 2002, Dowdell admitted to the fraud in the SECs action in a Consent and Stipulation, and the Court entered an order the same day permanently enjoining Dowdell from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The judgment provides that the amount of disgorgement and civil penalties that Dowdell will have to pay will be determined later.  On July 12, 2002, the Court appointed Roy M. Terry, Esq. and the law firm of DurretteBradshaw, PLC as Receiver over Dowdells assets and to develop a plan of distribution for the return of funds to injured investors., In his Consent and Stipulation, Dowdell admitted that other foreign nationals, including Shinder Gangar and Alan White, citizens and residents of the United Kingdom, have continued to raise investor funds in connection with the Vavasseur program even after November 19, 2001, and further admitted that various foreign banks have been used in furtherance of the fraud, including Overseas Development Bank &amp; Trust and Investors Bank &amp; Trust in Dominica, the Bank of Ireland in Ireland, Banamex Bank in Mexico, Butterfield Bank in the Commonwealth of Guernsey, Investec Bank in Israel, Fortis Bank in Belgium and Cathay Bank in Belize. , The SEC and Department of Justice have been coordinating their enforcement efforts with law enforcement authorities in the United Kingdom and other countries, including the U.K. Serious Fraud Office (SFO), the Leicestershire Constabulary, the U.K. Financial Services Authority (FSA), the Antwerp Police, and Irelands Criminal Asset Bureau.

In particular, Pacific Golf and Sarbaz are alleged to have repeatedly misrepresented facts indicating that the project would be completed quickly, that anticipated revenue from the project would be sufficient to repay investors when the securities matured, that in-tract financing for the project existed, that valuable land had been pledged as security for the municipal securities sold to investors, and that the developer had obtained contracts to sell developed lots to home-builders.  Sarbaz also is alleged to have failed to disclose lawsuits and liens filed against the development. Hill is alleged to have provided appraisal reports in support of the municipal securities offerings in which he intentionally or recklessly misrepresented the value of the Rancho Lucerne land pledged as a security for the benefit of the investors who purchased the Rancho Lucerne offerings.  According to the Commission, Hill opined that the Rancho Lucerne land was worth $28,000 per acre, or more, when, in reality, the land was worth several times less than that amount. , The Commission alleges in its complaint that Sarbaz, Pacific Golf Community Development, and Hill violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and also alleges that Hill aided and abetted violations Section 10(b) of Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5.

On December 27, 2000, the Commission sued now-defunct Pacific Genesis Group, Inc., the underwriter of these securities, and its chairman, David Fitzgerald, to stop the last Rancho Lucerne offering.

(February 26, 2003)</h2>, <h2>Glen Andrew Folck Consents to Pay a $50,000 Civil Penalty Relating to Improper Accounting at Smartalk Teleservices, Inc.</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the filing of a civil action in federal court against Glen Andrew Folck, the former Chief Financial Officer of SmarTalk TeleServices, Inc., a now-bankrupt provider of pre-paid telephone cards and wireless services.  The civil action arises from SmarTalks filing with the Commission materially false and misleading financial statements, which were also incorporated in registration statements for offerings of stock.  According to the Commissions Complaint, Folck, as CFO, was responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that were included in SmarTalks periodic reports and registration statements.  Folck consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, to pay a civil penalty of $50,000.  , On February 26, 2003, the Commission also issued a cease-and-desist order (Order) against Folck in a related administrative proceeding.  (<i>In the Matter of Glen Andrew Folck</i>, Administrative Proceeding File No. 3-11046)  The Order finds that Folck violated or caused violations of certain antifraud, reporting, and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws.  Folck also agreed to settle the cease-and-desist proceeding, without admitting or denying the findings in the Order., In its Complaint the Commission alleges the following:, As of the third quarter of 1997 and year-end 1998, SmarTalk filed with the Commission materially false and misleading financial statements, which were also incorporated in registration statements for offerings of stock filed with the Commission in September and December 1997, and May 1998.  Folck, as CFO, was responsible for the preparation of SmarTalks financial statements and signed all relevant annual and quarterly reports and registration statements and supervised the accounting department., SmarTalk falsely reported net income of $478,000 in its quarterly report for the third quarter of 1997.  In fact, SmarTalk had losses that period.  As Folck knew or should have known, SmarTalk hid the losses by improperly capitalizing ordinary operating expenses.  The expenses were improperly treated as an asset., Additionally, in SmarTalks annual report for its fiscal year ended December 31, 1997, which included audited financial statements, SmarTalk reported a one-time charge, a $25 million restructuring reserve, purportedly for anticipated 1998 costs, after its purchase of several other prepaid telephone card businesses.  As Folck knew or should have known, the entire restructuring reserve did not conform to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) because the anticipated costs were not proper restructuring costs and the company had failed to properly establish a plan of restructuring.  Also, as Folck knew or should have known, SmarTalk improperly understated current period operating expenses by charging 1997 operating expenses (including most of the above described expenses improperly capitalized as of the third quarter of 1997) against the non-GAAP restructuring reserve.  This enabled SmarTalk to falsely inflate earnings before one-time charges at year-end 1997.  In November 1998, SmarTalk restated its financial statements for year-end 1997 and its first two quarters of 1998.  , By engaging in the above conduct, Folck caused SmarTalks books and records to be falsified as of the third quarter of 1997 and year-end 1997 and thus, violated Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1., In addition to payment of a civil penalty, Folck agreed to the following sanctions ordered by the Commission in the administrative proceeding:  Folck was ordered to cease and desist from committing or causing violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1; Folck was ordered to cease and desist from causing violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 13a-1, 13a-13 and 12b-20; and Folck was ordered to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling $22,844.68 relating to his stock sales in January 1998., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18002.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18002.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Rhino Advisors, Inc. and Thomas Badian</i>, Civ. Action. No. 03 civ 1310 (RO) (Southern District of New York)</h2>]","[On February 27, 2003, the Commission filed a settled, civil action against Rhino Advisors, Inc. (Rhino) and its president, Thomas Badian (Badian), for directing a series of manipulative short sales of Sedona Corporation stock that contributed to the decline in the price of Sedonas stock.  Rhino, based in New York, NY, manages money for two overseas clients.  , The Commission alleges that Rhino and Badian manipulated Sedonas stock price to enhance a clients economic interests in a $3 million convertible debenture (the Debenture) that Sedona issued to Rhinos client.  The Debenture, negotiated by Badian, obligated Sedona to pay the client $3 million on March 22, 2001.  The Debenture granted the client the right to convert the Debenture into Sedona common stock at a discount to the market price during a five-day period prior to the conversion.  Based on this formula, the lower Sedonas stock price, the more shares the client would receive on conversion.  , The purchase agreement for the Debenture expressly prohibited Rhinos client from selling short shares of Sedonas stock while the Debenture remained issued and outstanding.  The Commission alleges that, despite this contractual provision, Rhino engaged in extensive short selling on behalf of its client prior to exercising the conversion rights under the Debenture and that this short selling depressed Sedonas stock price.  According to the Commission, as a result of the depressed stock price, Rhinos client received more shares from Sedona when it exercised its conversion rights under the Debenture than it otherwise would have received.  The Commission alleges that, following the conversions, Rhino engaged in wash sales and matched orders to cover the short positions and conceal the clients involvement in the scheme., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SECs complaint, Rhino and Badian have consented to the entry of an injunction for violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Rhino and Badian have consented to pay, on a joint and several basis, a $1,000,000 civil penalty.  In addition, Rhino has agreed to respond to an order directed to it by the Commission pursuant to Section 21(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and to hire an Independent Consultant, acceptable to the Commission, to review its compliance policies and procedures and to implement the Independent Consultants recommendation.

The Commission alleged in its complaint that Durante and DeTrano entered into an illegal funding scheme with AFTI pursuant to which AFTI provided 4.1 million shares of its stock to entities controlled by Durante and DeTrano, pursuant to sham consulting agreements.  Durante used those shares, along with an additional 3.3 million shares which he purchased on the market, to engage in manipulative trading activities, including matched orders and illegal block trades, which increased AFTIs stock price from $0.21 per share in December 1999 to $6.00 per share in March 2000, an increase of more than 2,700 percent., The judgment against all nine primary defendants permanently enjoins them from violating the anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws, Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Specifically, AFTI was ordered to pay $850,000 plus prejudgment interest of $176,094, for a total disgorgement of $1,026,094.  DeTrano was ordered to pay $401,112 plus prejudgment interest of $93,583, for a total disgorgement of $494,695, of which Commonwealth Partners was ordered jointly and severally liable with DeTrano for $198,188.

MacQueen (MacQueen), a resident of Orland Park Illinois, through MacQueen Capital Management and the Dividend Reinsvestment Fund, L.L.C. (the Fund).  The Complaint alleges that the defendants, MacQueen, MacQueen Capital Management and the Fund, raised over $1.35 million from at least five investors.  On the same day, Judge Matthew F. Kennelly of the Northern District of Illinois issued an asset freeze against the defendants., The Complaint alleges that MacQueen sold investors interests in the Fund that purported to purchase discounted stock through dividend reinvestment programs and to simultaneously sell the stock short to lock in a profit.  MacQueen claimed that the Fund generated annual returns of between 22% and 30% net of expenses.  MacQueen also claimed that he would only take a fee from the profits and that he currently manages $16 million.  The Complaint alleges that, contrary to these claims, the Fund did not earn significant sums in the last year, that MacQueen used money that he raised to buy a vacation home and that he used the remaining money that he raised to pay existing investors who wanted to liquidate their interests in the Fund.

The Court ordered Montle to pay the July 12, 2001 Judgment in monthly installments of $10,000 (beginning March 13) and to turn over assets to the Commission., In 1998, the Commission brought a civil enforcement action in the Southern District of New York against Montle as the lead figure in a series of federal securities law violations, which essentially included: (1) publishing, or causing to be published, numerous false and baseless sales reports and projections regarding Viral Testing Systems Corporation; (2) making false statements in Commission filings regarding Lone Star Casino Corporation; and (3) orchestrating a market-manipulation scheme designed to maintain and raise artificially the stock price of RMS Titanic, Inc., On July 12, 2001, after a bench trial, Judge Pollack entered a judgment against Montle (the AJudgment@) on all counts alleged in the Commissions complaint.  Judge Pollack:  (1) permanently enjoined Montle from violating various sections of the federal securities laws, including, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (2) ordered Montle to pay the Commission disgorgement plus pre-judgment interest thereon, totaling $365,092.25; (3) ordered Montle to pay a $50,000 civil penalty; (4) barred Montle for the period of five years from acting as an officer or director of a public company; and (5) prohibited Montle from participating, directly or indirectly, in the sale of securities pursuant to Regulations D and S of the Securities Act of 1933., Montle failed to pay the Judgment, and the Commission subsequently sought information from him concerning his assets.  However, Montle refused to produce this information, and on January 17, 2002, Judge Pollack ordered Montle to do so.  On January 30, 2002, after Montle still refused to provide the requested information (and to pay the Judgment), the Commission sought civil contempt sanctions against him.  In a final attempt to avoid payment, Montle filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas.  In April 2002, the Commission obtained a dismissal of Montles bankruptcy proceeding, and the Commission renewed its request for contempt sanctions before Judge Pollack.  Judge Pollack initially held that request in abeyance pending further investigation of Montles assets., On January 8, 2003, the Commission renewed its contempt motion against Montle in light of evidence that Montle had been hiding assets from the Commission.  On March 3, 2003, Judge Pollack granted the Commissions contempt motion and ordered Montle to pay the Commission in monthly installments of $10,000, with the first payment due March 13, 2003.  Additionally, Judge Pollack ordered Montle to produce information to the Commission regarding his assets and to turn over certain assets.  The order also allows the Commission to move the Court for an order of commitment if Montle disobeys this Order in any respect.  Judge Pollack found that Montle had engaged in obstructionism by failing to produce key documents to the Commission.  Judge Pollack further noted that Montles continuing refusal to pay a penny of the Judgment, at the same time that he maintained an admittedly extravagant lifestyle and hid assets, strikes this Court as contumacious conduct.,  ]"

The Commission claimed that, as a result of the actions of Mancuso, Lanchoney and Ally, Acrodyne engaged in inaccurate and improper cost accounting and revenue recognition.  The Commission also alleged that, starting in the second quarter of 1999 and continuing through the first quarter of 2000, Ally directed that unsupported journal entries be made to the cost of sales and inventory accounts to bring Acrodynes financial statements in line with the gross margin percentage he had estimated for period.

Larrabee (Larrabee), the former Director of Fiduciary Services at the law firm of Bingham, Dana &amp; Gould, which is now known as Bingham McCutchen, LLP (Bingham). Also on June 11, the Court entered a final judgment against Larrabee for insider trading that permanently enjoined him from future violations of Section10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, thereunder.   , On March 25, 1997, the Commission filed an insider trading complaint against Larrabee and James L. DAngelo (DAngelo) in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.  The complaint charged that in early December 1995, Bank of Boston retained Bingham to represent it in connection with its confidential proposed merger with BayBanks.  The indictment alleged that Larrabee learned of the pending deal, and on the afternoon of December 12, 1995, tipped DAngelo.  DAngelo promptly purchased $870,048 worth of Baybanks stock in eight accounts that he and his family controlled and in a ninth account in the name of his girlfriend.  Bank of Boston and BayBanks publicly announced the merger that evening.  The next morning, DAngelo sold all of the stock for an $86,750 profit.  , DAngelo previously consented to a permanent injunction against future violations of the securities laws, and paid disgorgement of $86,750, plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $8,552 and a civil penalty of $86,750, for a total of $182,052.  In addition, DAngelo agreed to a Commission order barring him from association with any broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, investment adviser or investment company.   , DAngelo and Larrabee previously were convicted of nine counts of securities fraud each for their insider trading in the stock of BayBanks.

Samuel Waksal, for illegal insider trading and failure to publicly disclose securities transactions.  Also today, Waksal consented to a partial resolution of the Commissions claims in which, among other things, Waksal will disgorge over $800,000 in illegal insider trading loss avoidance and profits, including prejudgment interest on those amounts, and be permanently barred from acting as an officer or director of any public company. , The Commission originally filed insider trading charges against Waksal on June 12, 2002 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  In its amended complaint, the Commission charges that in late December 2001, Waksal received disappointing news about ImClone, that the United States Food and Drug Administration was expected to soon issue a decision rejecting for review ImClones pending application to market its cancer treatment, Erbitux.  Before this news became public: (1) Waksal tried to sell a substantial amount of his own ImClone stock; (2) Waksal caused his daughter Aliza Waksal to sell all of her ImClone stock; (3) Waksal purchased ImClone put option contracts; and (4) Waksal told this negative information to a family member who sold ImClone stock.  The Commissions amended complaint alleges that based on this conduct, Waksal violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 16a-3 thereunder. , Specifically, the Commissions complaint alleges as follows., Waksal has agreed to a partial resolution, subject to the Courts approval, of certain of the charges in the amended complaint.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Waksal has consented to the entry of a partial final judgment in the Commissions action for his own attempted sale of ImClone stock in late December 2001, his options transactions on December 28, 2001, and the sale of ImClone stock in Alizas brokerage account.  Waksal has consented to: (a) a permanent injunction from future violations of 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 16a-3; (b) disgorge $804,367 representing the losses avoided by the sales of ImClone stock in Alizas account, plus prejudgment interest and Waksals profits from the options transactions he engaged in on December 28, 2001, plus prejudgment interest; and (c) an officer and director bar.  If the Court approves the proposed partial final judgment, resolution of the remaining issues in the case  specifically, the issues related to Waksals family members sale of ImClone stock on December 27 and 28, 2001 and civil penalties concerning the totality of the Commissions allegations against Waksal  will be stayed until entry of judgment with respect to all counts in <i>United States v.

The Defendants told investors that a company in New York manufactured the Needlyzer for Medical Disposal, when, in fact, no company was manufacturing the Needlyzer for Medical Disposal.  The Defendants told investors that Medical Disposal had negotiated contracts with foreign companies to purchase the Needlyzer, when, in fact, no such contracts existed.

Michael, Jr.)</h2>]","[On March 5, 2003, the Honorable James H. Michael, Jr., Senior U. S.  District Judge for the Western District of Virginia, Charlottesville Division, entered an order committing Terry Dowdell (Dowdell) to the custody of the United States Marshals Service for spending as much as $850,000 of investor funds that the Court had ordered frozen in a pending civil enforcement action brought against him by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Federal Marshals escorted Dowdell to jail the following day.  The jailing of Dowdell comes in connection with an order the Court entered on February 6, 2002, finding Dowdell in civil contempt finding for violating the asset freeze provisions contained in a temporary restraining order that the Court had entered on November 19, 2001, and extended in subsequent orders, against Dowdell and other defendants named in the SECs Complaint. , The SECs lawsuit stems from a massive international Ponzi scheme orchestrated by Terry L. Dowdell, in which Dowdell, utilizing various marketers, raised more than $70 million from investors in the U.S. and abroad for a fictitious trading program (the Vavasseur Program) purportedly involving the purchase and sale of foreign bank instruments and purportedly being operated by Vavasseur Corporation, a Bahamian corporation that is also named as a defendant in this action.   In June 2002, Dowdell admitted to the fraud in a consent and stipulation filed with the Court.   In December 2002, in a related criminal action, Dowdell pled guilty to charges of securities fraud, wire fraud and money laundering.  Dowdell is scheduled to be sentenced on May 5, 2003., The contempt motion against Dowdell was filed in January 2003 by the law firm of DurretteBradshaw, PLC, which had previously been appointed as Receiver over all of Dowdells assets.  The motion arose from the Commissions discovery that, notwithstanding the existence of an asset freeze covering all investor assets that had been invested in the Vavasseur Program, Dowdell, through Shinder Gangar and Alan White, two of Dowdells associates in Europe, caused in excess of $850,000 of Vavasseur investor funds to be repatriated into the United States into the bank account of three associates in California, Mark Smyth, Gregory Smyth and Jack Dempsey, who in turn dispersed approximately $450,000 of this amount, at Dowdells instructions, to Dowdell, his wife, his daughter and to Authorized Auto Service, Inc., an automobile repair company that Dowdell had created for his family and funded entirely with stolen investor funds.  All of this conduct occurred during a period of time in which Dowdell claimed to be cooperating with federal criminal and civil authorities., At a hearing conducted by the Court on February 5, 2002 in connection with the contempt motion, Dowdell filed a consent and stipulation admitting to virtually all of the Receivers allegations.  When examined by the Commission about such matters as the current location of investor funds and the possibility of additional, unlawful post-freeze transfers of funds, Dowdell asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege, but nonetheless asserted that he had no current access to Vavasseur investor funds., In the March 4 Order requiring Dowdells incarceration, the Court found that Dowdell has continuously played marbles on the coattails of the court.  There can be no reasonable assurances by Dowdell at this time that he will not continue to violate this courts orders if given the opportunity or that he is unable to purge his contempt.  Similarly, Dowdells assertion that he is no longer has access to funds is rendered hollow by his demonstrated prior access to funds., Citing to <u>United States v. Rylander</u>, 1983 Supreme Court decision, the Court reasoned that Dowdell could not assert inability to comply with a court order while at the same time refusing to answer further questions on the issue through invocation of the Fifth Amendment privilege.  The Court found that Dowdell, by asserting his Fifth Amendment privilege, had waived any argument he may have as to inability to comply with the courts repatriation and freeze orders, or to purge himself of the contempt. , , The Court ordered that Dowdell be incarcerated until such time that he fully and completely purges himself of contempt by repatriating and disgorging all Vavasseur funds and by telling the SEC and the Receiver where all Vavasseurs funds are located and how such funds may be obtained by the Receiver., In addition to finding Dowdell in contempt, the Court, in a separate ruling entered on February 12, 2003 found Mark Smyth and Gregory Smyth in civil contempt for their role in the secret repatriation and dissipation of the $850,000, and subsequently, in an order entered on February 27, 2003 entered judgment against them for the sum of $785, 000, plus prejudgment interest., Additional information concerning the SECs lawsuit against Dowdell can be found in <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17242.htm target=_top>Litigation Release No. 17242</a>, November 19, 2001; <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17454.htm target=_top>Release No. 17454</a>, April 2, 2002; [<a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17553.htm target=_top>Release No. 17553</a>], June 10, 2002; [<a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17880.htm target=_top>Release No. 17880</a>], October 10, 2002; [<a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17881.htm target=_top>Release No. 17881</a>], October 10, 2002; [<a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17905.htm target=_top>Release No. 17905</a>], December 19, 2002, and [<a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17999.htm target=_top>Release No. 17999</a>], February 26, 2003., Additional information about this lawsuit and about investor claims may be found at the Receivers website, located at http://www.dowdell-receivership.com., Additional information on how prime bank and other banking-related investment schemes work can be found at the SECs Prime Bank Fraud Information Center (<a href=/divisions/enforce/primebank.shtml target=_top>http://www.sec.gov/divisions/enforce/primebank.shtml</a>) in the enforcement section of the SECs website., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases________</i><br/>, <!--<IMG SRC=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=9 ALT= BORDER=0>  <a href=/litigation/complaints/compxxxx.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>--><!-- End text -->,  ]"

Howard, the former chief financial officer, and Michael W. Krautz, a former senior director of accounting, of Enron Broadband Services, Inc. (EBS), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Enron Corp., with violating the antifraud, periodic reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws., The Complaint, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, alleges that defendants Howard and Krautz engaged in a scheme to overstate the reported earnings of Enron, and its EBS subsidiary, by $111 million during the fourth quarter of 2000 and the first quarter of 2001.  The scheme, known as Project Braveheart, involved a sham sale of certain assets to accelerate recognition of income from a long-term agreement to develop and provide video-on-demand services.  Conceptually, defendants sought to sell an interest in the future revenues associated with this agreement for purposes of immediate income recognition.  As alleged in the Complaint, Project Braveheart was a sham from its inception:  the transaction had no economic substance and was created solely for the purpose of generating income., The Commissions Complaint alleges that defendants Howard and Krautz carried out the scheme by forming a purported joint venture, assigning the agreement to the joint venture, and selling an interest in the joint venture to a third party financial institution.  The entity enlisted by defendants Howard and Krautz to form the joint venture was a partner in name only and was never intended to participate in the joint venture.  The equity stake of this joint venture partner was not at risk because Enron guaranteed the entity a short-term take-out at a specified rate of return.  The financial institution to which Enron sold a portion of its interest in the joint venture also did not have equity at risk as required, having been guaranteed against loss by Enron.  As a result of Project Braveheart, Enron overstated its reported net income for the year 2000 by $53 million and for first quarter 2001 by $58 million., In its Complaint, the Commission charges Howard and Krautz with: violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; falsifying Enrons book and records, Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1; aiding and abetting Enrons filing of false and misleading quarterly reports, Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder; and aiding and abetting Enrons  books and records and internal accounting control violations, Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act.  The Commission is seeking disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil money penalties, a permanent bar from acting as a director or officer of a publicly held company, and an injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws., The Commission brought this action in coordination with the Justice Departments Enron Task Force, which today filed related criminal charges against Howard and Krautz. , The Commissions investigation is continuing.

In May, June and September 2000, Logan allegedly directed the Logan Childrens Trust, a trust for the benefit of Logans three minor children, to purchase 14,000 shares of MicroTouch stock in ten transactions.  Logan also failed to file the required SEC Forms 4 with the Commission that would have disclosed these purchases to the public.

The Trust tendered its shares to 3M for a profit of $177,375., Logan is charged with violating provisions of the federal securities laws prohibiting fraud, insider trading in the context of a tender offer and requiring insiders to report certain securities transactions.  In order to settle the charges, Logan agreed to pay a total of $581,536.27 in disgorgement, civil penalties and interest.

Kreiger, United States District Court Judge for the District of Colorado, entered an order granting the Commissions motion for summary judgment against defendant William L. Brotherton, an unlicensed chiropractor and the only executive officer of the company he founded, defendant International Business Consortium, Inc. (IBC).  In separate orders, the Court also resolved other motions in favor of the Commission, as explained below., The Commissions complaint, filed July 13, 2001, alleged that Brotherton and IBC raised over $300,000 by selling unregistered IBC stock to over 180 investors between January and July of 2001.  Holding IBC out as a promising start-up preparing to offer discount workers compensation insurance, IBC and Brotherton deceived investors about, among other things, IBCs true state of development and operations, a future initial public offering for IBC securities, the use of investment proceeds and the risks and returns associated with ownership of IBC stock.  Brotherton misappropriated at least 25% of the offering proceeds for the personal benefit of himself and certain of his relatives.  The complaint charged Brotherton and IBC with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Some of the proceeds of the defendants illegal conduct are held in bank accounts that were frozen pursuant to the courts preliminary injunction on consent and order freezing assets and granting other relief filed July 23, 2001., Finding no contested issue of material fact that Brotherton violated the federal securities laws, Judge Kreiger ordered him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains and pay prejudgment interest.  The court, however, did not permanently enjoin Brotherton from future violations of the securities laws, concluding that the Commission had not shown a likelihood that Brotherton would again engage in illegal conduct if not enjoined.  Judge Kreiger referred the matter to U.S. Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Coan for a recommendation regarding the amount of disgorgement and prejudgment interest and whether civil penalties should be assessed against Brotherton., In another order entered on March 3, 2003, Judge Kreiger granted the Commissions Motion for Default Judgment against IBC and permanently enjoined IBC from future violations of the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws.  The Court also ordered IBC to disgorge its ill-gotten gains and pay prejudgment interest, and referred the matter to Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Coan for a recommendation regarding the amount of disgorgement and prejudgment interest and whether civil penalties should be assessed against IBC., On March 3, 2003, Judge Kreiger also entered an order and judgment adopting a recommendation of Magistrate Judge Coan filed December 24, 2002 and denying Brothertons motion to name the Commission in a counterclaim, finding the proposed counterclaim barred by sovereign immunity and by Section 21(g) of the Exchange Act.  Judge Kreigers order also adopted the Magistrate Judges recommendation to strike the Defendants response to the Commissions complaint, and the court sua sponte struck a pending motion by the defendants to dismiss the Commissions action., This enforcement action is part of the Commissions four-pronged approach to minimizing microcap fraud:  enforcement, inspections, investor education, and regulation.

In its complaint, the SEC alleges that, from at least 1997 through 2001, Ratfield raised over $4 million from about 120 investors by selling interests in two investment clubs, purported Common Law Trusts called Stonehenge Enterprises Pure Trust and The Baron Financial Services., According to the SECs complaint, Ratfield promised returns of up to 26% or 40%.  Ratfield also told investors that their investment principal was fully insured from loss and that they could redeem their investments annually.  In actuality, Ratfield used the majority of the investors funds to invest in risky start-up businesses.

Tx)</h2>, <h2>SEC Charges Merrill Lynch, Four Merrill Lynch Executives with Aiding and Abetting Enron Accounting Fraud </h2>, <h2>Merrill Lynch Simultaneously Settles Charges for Permanent Anti-Fraud Injunction and Payment of $80 Million in Disgorgement, Penalties and Interest </h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Inc. and four of its former senior executives with aiding and abetting Enron Corp.s securities fraud.  The Commissions complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Houston, alleges that Merrill Lynch and its former executives aided and abetted Enron Corp.s earnings manipulation by engaging in two fraudulent year-end transactions in 1999.  The transactions had the purpose and effect of overstating Enrons reported financial results.  Specifically, Enron used these transactions to add approximately $60 million to its fourth quarter of 1999 income (improving net income from $199 million to $259 million or 33 percent) and to increase its full year 1999 earnings per share from $1.09 to $1.17., Simultaneous with the filing of this action, the Commission has agreed to accept Merrill Lynchs offer to settle this matter.  Merrill Lynch, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, has agreed to pay $80 million dollars in disgorgement, penalties and interest and has agreed to the entry of a permanent anti-fraud injunction prohibiting future violations of the federal securities laws.  The Commission intends to have these funds paid into a court account pursuant to the Fair Fund provisions of Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for ultimate distribution to victims of the fraud.  The four former Merrill Lynch executives named in the complaint, Robert S. Furst, Schuyler M. Tilney, Daniel H. Bayly, and Thomas W. Davis, are contesting the matter., The Commissions complaint alleges that, in late December 1999, senior Enron executives approached Merrill Lynch with the two transactions it had designed.  As alleged, the first transaction was an asset-parking arrangement whereby on December 29, 1999, Merrill Lynch bought an interest in certain Nigerian barges from Enron with an express understanding that Enron would arrange for the sale of this interest by Merrill Lynch within six months at a specified rate of return.  In substance, this transaction was, at best, a bridge loan because the risks and rewards of ownership of the interest in the barges did not pass to Merrill Lynch. , As further alleged in the complaint, Merrill Lynch and the named executives knew that Enron would record $28 million in revenue and $12 million in pre-tax income in connection with this transaction.  The Commission alleges that Merrill Lynch and the named executives entered into this transaction solely to accommodate Enron, despite express concerns that Merrill Lynch could appear to be aiding and abetting Enrons earnings manipulation.  In 2000, Enron arranged to take Merrill Lynch out of the barge deal on the agreed time frame at the agreed rate of return.  , In the second transaction, also closed in the last days of December 1999, Merrill Lynch and Enron entered into two energy options  one physical and one financial  that Merrill Lynch knew had the purpose and effect of inflating Enrons income by approximately $50 million.  The complaint details that, at year-end 1999, the trading under these options was not scheduled to begin for approximately nine months.  Before the transaction was closed, the complaint alleges, Enron told Merrill Lynch that, despite a nominal term of four years, it might want to unwind this transaction early.  , Merrill Lynch believed that the two trades were essentially a wash and knew that the transaction would have a significant impact on Enrons reported results, bonuses, and stock price.  Merrill Lynch demanded a multi-million dollar fee for entering into this transaction; Enron ultimately agreed to pay Merrill Lynch a structured fee to be paid over four years with a net present value of $17 million.  In 2000, Enron approached Merrill Lynch seeking to unwind the transaction before trading under the energy options was scheduled to begin.  The deal was unwound in June 2000 after Merrill Lynch agreed to reduce its fee to $8.5 million to terminate the transaction., The complaint alleges that Merrill Lynch and the named executives aided and abetted Enrons violations of the anti-fraud, reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws.  For these violations, the Commission seeks in its complaint a permanent injunction, disgorgement, and civil penalties with respect to Merrill Lynch and, with respect to the individual defendants, permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and permanent officer and director bars., Simultaneous with the filing of the complaint, Merrill Lynch agreed to file a consent and final judgment settling the Commissions action against it.  In the consent, Merrill Lynch has agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2), and 13(b)(5) and of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934  and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, and 13b2-1 thereunder.  , Merrill Lynch also has agreed to pay disgorgement, penalties and interest in the amount of $80 million.  Specifically, Merrill Lynch will pay $37.5 million in disgorgement, $5 million in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $37.5 million.  As noted above, the Commission intends to have these funds paid into a court account pursuant to the Fair Fund provisions of Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for ultimate distribution to victims of the fraud. , In agreeing to resolve this matter on the terms described above, the Commission took into account certain affirmative conduct by Merrill Lynch.  Merrill Lynch terminated Messrs. Davis and Tilney after they refused to testify before the staff and instead asserted their Fifth Amendment rights.  In addition, Merrill Lynch brought the energy trade transaction to the staffs attention at a time when it believed the staff was unaware of its existence., The Commission acknowledges the assistance provided by the staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in this investigation.  , The Commission also acknowledges the continuing coordination among the Division of Enforcement, the Justice Department Enron Task Force and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the Enron investigation., The Commissions investigation is continuing.

Sheehan and Jason T. Frazee in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  Sheehan and Frazee each consented, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, to pay civil penalties of $10,000.  The Commission also announced the issuance of settled cease-and-desist orders against Sheehan and Frazee.  The Orders find that Sheehan and Frazee engaged in a fraudulent trading practice known as spoofing.  The scheme is used by traders to exploit the Commissions Limit Order Display Rule and market makers willingness to execute customer orders at the National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO) price.  Spoofing involves placing small limit orders for thinly traded NASDAQ securities at prices that are between the current NBBO prices.  The conduct artificially narrows the quoted spreads on securities, allowing traders to take advantage of the improved prices by executing much larger orders on the opposite side of the market., An example of spoofing from the Commissions Order against Sheehan is as follows:  he placed a limit order to sell 100 shares of Barrett Business Services, Inc. (BBSI) at $3.375 per share, when the best offer side of the NBBO was $3.937 per share.  He directed that the trade be routed to an electronic communications network and, due to the Limit Order Display Rule, his order became the new best offer price.  He then placed two orders to buy 1,000 shares of BBSI at $3.375 per share through another market making firm.  Sheehan obtained immediate execution at that price because the other market maker honored the best offer price created by Sheehans sell order.  By doing this, Sheehan decreased his aggregate cost of buying BBSI by $1,125, or $.562 per share, because he was able to purchase 2,000 shares of BBSI at $3.375 per share (the offer price after he moved the market) rather than at $3.937 per share (the offer price before he moved the market).  After his buy orders were executed, Sheehan canceled his sell order., The Commissions Orders find that, on twenty-five and sixteen occasions, respectively, Sheehan and Frazee placed orders that improved the NBBO, immediately had orders executed on the opposite side of the market at the improved price, and then canceled (or attempted to cancel) the initial order.  As a result, Sheehan and Frazee obtained otherwise unobtainable execution prices in violation of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, Sheehan and Frazee were ordered to cease and desist from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to pay disgorgement plus prejudgment interest of $11,558 and $21,011, respectively.  , The Commission acknowledges the assistance provided by the National Association of Securities Dealers in connection with these matters. , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18040.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18040.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

According to the Commissions complaint, the company touted in press releases, a Commission filing and a newsletter its increased revenues and business expansion without disclosing that many of its machines and bank accounts had been seized by Texas law enforcement authorities for allegedly violating the states gaming laws.  The Commission further alleges in its complaint that the defendants engaged in prohibited insider trading by selling BGI stock before BGI publicly disclosed the seizures, avoiding losses totaling about $562,000.  , The defendants are:, The Commission alleges in its complaint that between October 2001 and January 2002, BGI, through Funderburk and Reckdenwald, issued misleading press releases and authorized a misleading Internet-based investor newsletter, and that Funderburk was responsible for BGIs filing with the Commission on November 15, 2001 a misleading quarterly report.  The BGI press releases, newsletter and quarterly report were materially misleading because, while trumpeting BGIs ongoing revenue growth and business expansion, they contained no reference to recent seizures by Texas authorities  for BGIs possible violations of Texas gaming laws  of a substantial number of BGIs sweepstakes machines and proceeds derived from the machines.  During this period, BGIs stock price increased from $0.89 per share to over $5 per share.

On July 6, 2000, the Commission amended its complaint to allege that Aziz-Golshani and another defendant also had manipulated the prices of the eleven other stocks at issue in the Courts present ruling.  <i>See</i> <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr16620.htm>Lit. Rel.16620</a> (July 6, 2000).  On May 23, 2001, the Court granted the Commission partial summary judgment against Aziz-Golshani for his role in the alleged manipulation of NEI Webworld, Inc. (NEIP).  The Court required Aziz-Golshani to pay disgorgement of $152,742.50 and imposed a civil penalty in the same amount., In a parallel criminal case concerning NEIP, on January 22, 2001, Aziz-Golshani was sentenced to 15 months incarceration and ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $566,433.  <i>See</i> <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr16867.htm>Lit.

Scrushy., The <a href=/litigation/complaints/comphealths.htm>Commissions complaint</a> alleges that since 1999, at the insistence of Scrushy, HRC systematically overstated its earnings by at least $1.4 billion in order to meet or exceed Wall Street earnings expectations.  The false increases in earnings were matched by false increases in HRCs assets.  By the third quarter of 2002, HRCs assets were overstated by at least $800 million, or approximately 10 percent.  The complaint further alleges that, following the Commissions order last year requiring executive officers of major public companies to certify the accuracy and completeness of their companies financial statements, Scrushy certified HRCs financial statements when he knew or was reckless in not knowing they were materially false and misleading., According to the complaint:, The Commission alleges that HRCs and Scrushys actions violated and/or aided and abetted violations of the antifraud, reporting, books-and-records, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws.  Specifically, the Commission has charged HRC with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13.

As part of the default judgment, the court issued a permanent injunction against Jean Pierre, ordered Jean Pierre to pay $589,809.32, representing $407,700 in ill-gotten gains derived from his fraudulent conduct plus prejudgment interest of $182,809.32, and ordered Jean Pierre to pay a $407,000 civil penalty.  Pursuant to Section 308 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the court ordered that the civil penalty be added to the disgorgement fund for the benefit of investors.  , , In its suit, the Commission charged Jean Pierre, as well as other defendants, with making false and misleading statements and omissions of material facts while offering and selling limited partnerships interests of JB Stanley Group, LP (JB Stanley), an unregistered hedge fund, and stock of JB Stanleys general partner, Cambridge Capital Holdings Management, LLC (Cambridge), and Cambridges wholly-owned subsidiary, Union Transfer and Cargo Corporation (UTC), all of which were controlled by Jean Pierre.

Additionally, the Court made findings which concluded that the conduct of the defendants involved fraud, deceit, manipulation or deliberate or reckless disregard of a regulatory requirement and that their violations directly or indirectly resulted in substantial losses or created a significant risk of substantial losses to other persons.  Lazorwitz, Reives and Tri-Star have been permanently enjoined from further securities laws violations, by earlier orders of the Court.     , The Court concluded in its order that a multimillion-dollar, nationwide securities fraud had been conducted by Lazorwitz and Reives who promoted the fraudulent scheme as Tri-Stars general partners, in which they used the general partnership to offer and sell unregistered securities in Tri-Star to over 900 investors in at least 35 states, and raised at least $15 million.  Tri-Star, Lazorwitz, and Reives made material misrepresentations and omissions of fact to investors concerning, among other things, the use of investor funds, the expected returns, and investment risks.  Lazorwitz and Reives misappropriated investor funds for their personal benefit.  Tri-Star, through Lazorwitz and Reives, initially represented that Tri-Star would invest in bank debentures and later claimed that it might invest in other international trade opportunities.  Lazorwitz and Reives promoted Tri-Star directly and through independent agents around the United States known as Facilitators and led investors to expect profits of 20% per month in so-called 13-month trading programs, after an initial 90-day waiting period.

The complaint alleges that Hunter and Papalia, who were officers and directors of Nano World a company that operated out of South Bothell, Washington, issued false press releases in 2000 and 2001 that misrepresented the companys commitments for financing to develop its business, misrepresented it was in a partnership with Fiat Group to develop nano-technology when it did not have the financial resources to meet its obligations under the  agreement, and misrepresented its acquisition of another company and the terms of sale of its assets to a third-party, among other things.  These  false and misleading press releases, one of which was distributed to thousands of potential investors over the Internet, caused increases in the price and volume of Nano Worlds stock, which was traded at the time on the National Association of Securities Dealers Bulletin Board under the symbol NAPH but has since been delisted.  The complaint also alleges that Papalia caused Nano World to file a false report with the SEC about the acquisition of another company, and that he caused Nano World to fail to file quarterly and annual reports which are required of public companies., The Commission alleged that Papalia and Hunter violated the anti-fraud provisions of  Sections 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5, and that Papalia also aided and abetted Nano Worlds violations of the corporate reporting provisions of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13.

Based in Holtsville, New York, Symbol is a leading manufacturer of bar code scanners and related information technology whose stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange.  The complaint alleges that <b>Asti</b> played a key role in fabricating millions of dollars in sales revenue while heading Symbols sales finance department from 1999 until he left the company in March 2001.  <b>Asti</b>, age 44, was Vice President of Sales Finance for The Americas Sales and Services (TASS) at Symbol, which included Symbols sales operations in North and South America., The Commissions complaint alleges that:, <p class=quote>Among other fraudulent accounting practices, <b>Asti</b> and others stuffed Symbols distribution channel at the end of each quarter to help meet revenue and earnings targets imposed by Symbols president at that time.  Together with others, <b>Asti</b> engineered phony sales in which resellers placed large purchase orders but were given the right not to pay for the products, either orally or in side letters.  <b>Asti</b> also arranged for Symbol to make payments to certain resellers to induce them to place orders and accept shipments in excess of their financial means.  <b>Asti</b> also employed other fraudulent devices to accelerate revenue on sales to end users when the product the end user wanted was unavailable or could not be shipped before the end of the quarter for other reasons.  <b>Asti</b> and his sales finance staff improperly controlled critical aspects of Symbols revenue recognition process such as the booking of orders and the issuance of invoices and credits., <p class=quote>As a result of these and other fraudulent practices, Symbol falsely reported record revenue and dramatic increases in net income in press releases and periodic reports filed with the Commission and disseminated to the public.

Ohms had previously plead guilty to one count of wire fraud and one count of making a false statement to a government agency, in this case, the Commission, in furtherance of his scheme., In a complaint filed on October 29, 2002, the Commission charged Ohms with financial fraud and other securities law violations related to his embezzlement from the company over a four-year period.  According to the Commissions complaint, Ohms held a number of positions at U.S. Lime between January 1998 and December 2001, including corporate controller, secretary, treasurer, and vice president of finance.  The Commissions complaint further alleged that Ohms forged the signatures of other company officers on dozens of checks, and falsified the companys check register to create the appearance that the amounts that he personally received or gave to his creditors went to vendors for U.S. Limes legitimate business expenses.  Additionally, the complaint alleged that while Ohms initially embezzled relatively small amounts, his thefts escalated to the point that they were too large to conceal, at which point he abruptly resigned.  As a part of his scheme, Ohms caused U.S. Lime to file false and misleading Forms 10-K and 10-Q with the Commission as well as a December 2000 registration statement for an offering of subscription rights for U.S. Lime common stock., On November 12, 2002, Judge Sidney A.

Damato, the former president and chief executive officer of Eagle Building Technologies, Inc., a company located in Boca Raton, Florida, to disgorge trading profits from his sales of Eagle Building stock in the amount of $56,263 plus prejudgment interest of $5,637, and to cancel 286,500 shares of stock he received as compensation for acting as an officer and director of the company.  Damato agreed to give up an additional 81,242 shares to satisfy the requirement that he repay his trading profits and prejudgment interest.  Damato consented to the order without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint., Damato previously consented to entry of a permanent injunction on October 22, 2002 that prohibits him from making false statements in press releases and reports made to the SEC, creating false business records, and providing false information to the companys auditors in violation of the anti-fraud, periodic reporting and internal record-keeping provisions of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2, and aiding and abetting Eagle Buildings violations of Section 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13.  The SEC alleged that Damato created false purchase orders and bank records for business supposedly conducted by the company in India, which he then provided to accountants to inflate the revenues reported by the company in its annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC, and false press releases that were distributed to the investing public.  Damato sold stock during the time period when the false press releases and false reports were circulated to the investing public and made profits of $56,263. The district court also barred Mr. Damato from acting as an officer or director of any public company.  Mr. Damato consented to entry of the permanent injunction without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint, which was filed against him on March 1, 2002. , The Commission alleged in its complaint that Damato, as the president and chief executive officer of Eagle Building Technologies Inc., and the company engaged in a massive financial fraud by falsely recognizing millions of dollars of non-existent revenue from Eagle Buildings purported sales of cement building blocks through its foreign operations in India.  This revenue, which was reported in the companys annual report for 2000 filed with the SEC on Form 10-K and its quarterly reports filed on Forms 10-Q for the first three quarters of 2001, was almost completely fictitious, according to the complaint.  The Commission alleged that Damato created false purchase orders and bank records to create the appearance of foreign transactions, which he then provided to the companys accountants.   Additionally, the complaint asserts that Damato and the company issued three false and misleading press releases after September 11, 2001 touting anti-terrorism security measures marketed by Eagle that capitalized on the publics anxiety post-September 11.  , The district court previously entered a permanent injunction against Eagle Building on May 20, 2002, based on the consent of the company in which it neither admitted nor denied the allegations of the complaint.  The order prohibits the company from violating the anti-fraud, periodic reporting and internal record keeping provisions of the federal securities laws., On February 15, 2002, the Commission suspended trading in the securities of Eagle Building Technologies Inc. (symbol EGBT) for ten days to allow the investing public to obtain accurate information about the company.  At that time, the companys stock was trading on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board System (OTCBB).  On February 28, 2002, the National Association of Securities Dealers delisted the securities of Eagle Building from trading on the OTCBB.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18054.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

According to the Commissions complaint, Jack Calvin of Ozark, Missouri organized the fraudulent scheme.  The complaint alleges that defendants Byron Nernoff of Roslyn Heights, New York; James Proffitt of Tomkinsville, Kentucky; Daniel Wayne Adams of Sandwich, Massachusetts; and Charles Timson of Greenlawn, New York each solicited investors in exchange for commissions., According to the Commissions complaint, the defendants offered and sold securities in a financial instrument trading program called Growth Benefit Systems that was completely fictitious.  Defendants allegedly solicited investors using misrepresentations typical of Prime Bank investment frauds, telling investors that their funds would be pooled to purchase letters of credit that would be traded by top-rated banks and promising returns as high as 20% per month.  The defendants also allegedly told investors that their principal would be guaranteed.  In fact, according to the complaint, there are no such trading programs and defendants representations to investors were completely false., Instead of investing the funds he obtained, Calvin used investor money to pay commissions to the four defendant salespersons.  Nernoff and Proffitt allegedly received more than $200,000 each.  Adams allegedly received $51,386 and Timson $58,151.  Calvin also used investor money to make luxury purchases for himself and his daughter, including a house, car, motorcycle, hot tub and furniture. The Commission also alleged that Calvin paid for his daughters tuition at cosmetology school with investor proceeds., According to the complaint, after Calvin spent the investors funds, he made numerous false statements to investors to explain why they had not received the purported profits from the trading program, including that the events of September 11, 2001, somehow delayed fund transfers., During the Commissions investigation, Calvin and Timson, a Long Island physician, failed to comply with Commission subpoenas.  The Commission filed subpoena enforcement actions which resulted in court orders requiring Calvin and Timson to provide testimony to the Commission staff., Adams, a commercial airline pilot, also failed to comply with the Commission subpoena issued to him.  Instead Adams, who was born in Kansas, sent notice that he had expatriate[d] from the corporate United States.  Adams further stated that he was no longer a citizen of the United States.  Ultimately, Adams appeared for testimony and produced documents., According to the complaint, Calvin, Nernoff, Proffitt, Adams and Timson violated the antifraud, securities registration, and broker registration provisions of the federal securities laws, including Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The investor requested reimbursement of the monies and on September 24, 2002 the Court ordered Hatfield to pay the investor $25,000.  The Court granted Hatfield numerous extensions of time within which to pay the investor with a final deadline of January 6, 2003.  To date, Hatfield has failed to pay any money to the investor.  The Court has ordered Hatfield to appear at a hearing on April 10, 2003 to show cause why he should not be held in contempt for failing to abide by the terms of the Courts May 6, 2002 Order., For more information on earlier actions in this case, see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17441.htm>Litigation Release No. 17441</a> (March 27, 2002), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17747.htm>Litigation Release No. 17747</a> (September 26, 2002) and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17748.htm>Litigation Release No. 17748</a> (September 26, 2002).,  ]"

Conwell, a Lake Bluff, Illinois resident.  The indictment charged Conwell with six counts of mail fraud, five counts of making false statements to financial institutions, and one count of obstructing an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  According to the indictment, between April 1998 and March 2001, Conwell, sole owner of Lake Forest Financial Group, Ltd., (LFFG), engaged in a scheme to defraud his clients by making material misstatements and omissions concerning the use of the funds he received for investments and insurance products, and the profitability of these investments.  The indictment alleged that Conwell used the money he received for his personal benefit and the benefit of his business, including making payments to earlier investors without disclosing the Ponzi scheme nature of the payments.  The indictment also charged that Conwell lied to four different banks to obtain more than $2.5 million in loans, and also, that Conwell made false statements to the staff of the SEC during its investigation into Conwells activities.    , In January of 2000, the SEC filed a civil complaint against Conwell and LFFG in connection with the scheme described above, alleging that Conwell and his firm had violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  On January 31, 2000, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered a final judgment order against Conwell and LFFG, pursuant to their consent, which enjoined them from further violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, ordered them to disgorge more than $780,000 of ill-gotten gains, plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $80,000.

Platinum Investment Corp., et al.</i> (S.D.N.Y. 02 CIV. 6093 (JSR))</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced today that on March 25, 2003, the Honorable Jed S. Rakoff, United States District Court Judge for the Southern District of New York, issued an order granting relief sought by the Commission against two non-parties who received assets from a transaction that violated an earlier order freezing the assets of defendant Platinum Investment Corporation (Platinum)., On August 13, 2002, the court entered a Partial Final Consent Judgment against Platinum that, among other things, permanently enjoined Platinum from violating antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws (Partial Final Judgment).  In Paragraph X of the Partial Final Judgment, the court also ordered that Platinums assets shall remain frozen until Platinum makes full payment of all amounts that Platinum is required or shall later be required to pay pursuant to the Partial Final Judgment (Asset Freeze Order).  In the March 25, 2003 order and prior orders relating to the same subject, the court found that on September 24, 2002, Platinum conveyed real property to its presidents maternal grandfather, Lee Sidoti, in violation of the Asset Freeze Order.  The court further found that the mortgage proceeds from that sale were deposited in a bank account held by an entity called White Orchid, an entity that was owned by Sidoti and controlled by his daughter, Margaret Antonucci, the mother of Platinums president.  The court also found that Antonucci then withdrew that money from the account in cash., As a result of these transactions, the court previously issued an order freezing Sidotis assets up to the amount of the purchase price of the real property, because, among other reasons, the court drew an adverse inference against Sidoti from his assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination at a deposition.  In its March 25, 2003 order, the court denied Sidotis motion to vacate the order freezing his assets despite the fact that Sidoti had testified since then that he had no knowledge of the original Asset Freeze Order when he took title to the property.  The court held that Sidoti was bound by the knowledge of his agent  Antonucci  to whom he delegated virtually all responsibilities in connection with the transactions here at issue.  The court concluded that Antonucci had actual notice of the Asset Freeze Order, because in addition to undertaking substantial business with Platinum on behalf of Sidoti, she was an officer of Platinum and the mother of its president.  Moreover, Antonucci did not testify, and the court found that the evidence strongly supports plaintiffs charge that Mrs. Antonucci acted in concert with defendants with full knowledge of the [Asset Freeze Order] when she withdrew the funds from the White Orchid account.  As a result, the court ordered Antonucci to return those funds., The underlying allegations of the Commissions case concern the fraudulent, unregistered offering of securities by Platinum and the other defendants.  The Commissions complaint, filed on July 31, 2002, alleges that Platinum and the other defendants, which include former Platinum associates Lee Antonucci and Andrew Antonucci, defrauded dozens of investors of over $1.5 million by misrepresenting material facts about defendant Platinum Investment Holding Corp. (PIHC), purportedly a financial services firm looking to raise capital, and New Focus Capital Partners (New Focus), purportedly a hedge fund with a proven track record.  The defendants falsely claimed, among other things, that PIHC was on the verge of launching an initial public offering (IPO) even though PIHC did not file a registration statement with the Commission or otherwise take any steps toward an IPO, and that New Focus used a successful trading program purportedly owned by PIHC when, in fact, New Focus was a sham., The litigation is still pending.

If convicted, Shariff faces a maximum penalty of five years incarceration on each mail and wire fraud count, ten years incarceration on each securities fraud count, and ten to twenty years incarceration on the money laundering counts.  Shariffs whereabouts are currently unknown.  , The indictment alleges that from at least March 1996 through June 2001, Shariff was the President of Vestron Financial Corporation (Vestron Financial), a North Carolina corporation that Shariff used to sell partnership interests in several entities he controlled, including Vestron Investment Club, Crescent Capital Partners LP, and Crescent Capital Offshore Fund (collectively referred to as Vestron entities), raising about $11 million from investors nationwide.  The partnership interests were sold to investors who were told that Shariff would invest their money in securities and commodities in return for a prearranged fee.  According to the indictment, Shariff misappropriated millions of dollars from investors for his own use and benefit by making material misrepresentations and omitting to state material facts concerning the use of investor funds and the profitability of investments made through or on behalf of the Vestron entities.  , The indictment derives from the same activity that led to the Commissions filing of its complaint against Shariff in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida on October 16, 2001.  The Commission charged Shariff with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act.

Kane, Jr., a former registered representative charged with defrauding customers of two brokerage firms at which he was employed.  , In its compliant, the Commission alleged that Kane defrauded investors by investing without authorization and, in some cases, simply stealing a total of nearly $600,000 of their cash or securities.  The Commission also alleged that Kane fabricated documents and made additional misrepresentations to his victims to conceal his fraudulent conduct.  On April 11, 2002, the court entered a partial final consent judgment (Partial Final Judgment) against Kane permanently enjoining him from violating antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  In the Partial Final Judgment, the court also ordered that if the parties could not agree on a civil penalty amount, the court would make the determination., In its March 31, 2003 order, the court imposed a $200,000 civil penalty after considering several mitigating circumstances proffered by Kane, including a claim that he is impoverished and, as a result, may not be able to pay if a severe penalty is imposed  a factual contention that the Commission questioned in its motion papers.  The court stated that, in light of the goal of deterrence, a defendants claims of poverty cannot defeat the imposition of a civil penalty.  The court went on to hold as follows:  , Even if Kanes proffered representations concerning his bleak financial condition are complete and accurate, his financial problems, including his inability to work again as a stock broker, are the natural consequences of his fraudulent conduct.  Kanes predicament is shared by many defendants in similar cases, and if given the weight Kane urges, a defendants impecuniosity could preclude the imposition of a meaningful penalty in even those cases involving the most egregious fraud.  In addition, the court agrees with the Commission that it should not ignore the possibility that a defendants fortunes will improve, and that one day the SEC will be able to collect on even a severe judgment.     , All of the Commissions claims for relief against Kane have now been resolved.  Kane previously also pleaded guilty to parallel criminal charges brought by the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18066.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Collins, 56, of Plainfield, Illinois was charged in a criminal information with three counts of mail fraud and one count of wire fraud for allegedly defrauding approximately 400 prospective investors and investors of more than $10 million.  Collins and others owned and controlled the Gateway Association, Inc. (Gateway), based in Naperville, Illinois which sold memberships and purported to offer and sell investments to its members with a guaranteed, risk-free, high yield return of as much as 1,250 percent.  Between November 1997 and March 1999, Collins and others, through Gateway, allegedly offered and sold investment interests in a non-existent international bank debenture trading program.  Collins and others allegedly made material misrepresentations and omitted to state material facts about the existence of the trading program, the risk and expected return on the investment, the use of money raised from the investors, and the ability of investors to obtain a full refund at any time.  Collins and others raised approximately $10,984,564 from at least 400 investors and allegedly misused almost all of the funds for their own benefit, including autos, charter airplanes, guns, credit card bills, printing expenses, a country club membership, a piano and landscaping.  , According to the charges, Collins and others organized meetings at various locations in the United States and Puerto Rico, where they informed prospective investors that they could become members in Gateway for a fee of $2,500, which would enable them to receive various benefits, including discounts on shopping, travel, hotels and health care.  Gateway members also would be eligible to invest additional money in the so-called international bank debenture trading program.  Collins allegedly fraudulently promised investors a 1,250 percent rate of return on a 10-month $100,000 investment, which included a $759,768 balloon payment at the end of 10 months.  Almost no investors have received a refund of their original investment, according to the charges.  Collins is scheduled to be arraigned on April 8 before U.S. District Court Judge Suzanne B. Conlon in Chicago.  If convicted, Collins faces a maximum statutory penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine on each count of mail and wire fraud.  As an alternative fine, the Court may impose a fine totaling twice the gross loss to any victim or twice the gross gain to the defendant, whichever is greater. , In the civil action filed by the SEC, <i>SEC v.

In December 2002, Bill Wilson, of Naperville, Illinois, the President of Gateway, also consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, to the entry of a permanent injunction, payment of disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty, the amounts of which are to be determined later at a separate hearing.

U.S. District Judge Sim Lake granted the SECs requests for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze against Rocky Mountain, its CEO, John N. Ehrman, and its General Counsel, W. Roderick Johnson, Sr.  The Court also appointed a temporary receiver to take control of Rocky Mountain and the assets of Ehrman.  The complaint also named John W. Ehrman, Jr., Ehrmans father, as a relief defendant to recover proceeds from the alleged fraud in his possession or control., The complaint alleges that, from July 2002 to the present, Ehrman and Johnson used four bogus share-exchange transactions to secretly obtain control of approximately 50% of Rocky Mountains issued and outstanding stock.  Additionally, it is alleged that Rocky Mountain and Ehrman issued a stream of glowing but false and misleading press releases to artificially inflate the price and trading volume of the companys stock.  The press releases and other promotional statements, touted numerous acquisitions of valuable oil-and-gas properties, or agreements to acquire such properties, along with expected revenues and other benefits from the acquisitions.  The complaint alleges that Rocky Mountain had neither the assets nor the financing to complete these acquisitions.  Concurrent with the misleading public announcements, it is alleged that Ehrman and Johnson dumped more than $800,000 of Rocky Mountain stock into the unsuspecting marketplace., In carrying out the fraudulent scheme, Ehrman allegedly caused Rocky Mountain to file false and misleading reports and registration statements with the SEC.  Among other things, these filings failed to disclose that Ehrman and Johnson caused Rocky Mountain to issue approximately 47 million shares of stock in the four sham share-exchange transactions.  The filings also misrepresented, among other things, Ehrman and Johnsons ownership, transfer, and sale of approximately 31 million of these shares.  , The SEC also alleged that, as part of the orchestrated manipulation, Ehrman and Johnson caused Rocky Mountain to file a number of false and misleading petitions and other documents in fairness proceedings in a Utah state court in an attempt to cloak their fraudulent activities from detection.<br/>It is alleged in the complaint that, in connection with the scheme, Rocky Mountain, Ehrman, and Johnson violated the anti-fraud and securities-registration provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  It is also alleged that Rocky Mountain violated, and that Ehrman aided and abetted violations of, the issuer-reporting provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Sections 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder.

The false increases in earnings were matched by false increases in HealthSouths assets. By the third quarter of 2002, HealthSouths assets were overstated by at least $1.3 billion, or approximately 20 percent., The complaint charged that, Livesay, Ayers, Morgan, Edwards and Valentine, in furtherance of the above scheme, made or directed other HealthSouth employees to make false accounting entries to inflate reported operating results. The Commission also charged that Morgan engaged in insider trading by selling at least 20,000 shares of HealthSouth stock while knowing that HealthSouths financial statements grossly misstated the companys earnings and assets.  , The Commissions complaint against Livesay, Ayers, Morgan, Edwards and Valentine charges that they each violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and aided and abetted HealthSouths violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) and of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.

In its Complaint, the Commission alleged that, from at least June through September 2001, Ingardia, who had been employed at several broker-dealers including Joseph Stevens &amp; Co. and the now defunct Mason Hill &amp; Co., began making telephone calls to several other brokerage firms, including Fidelity Investments, Charles Schwab &amp; Co. and Brown &amp; Co., in which he assumed the identity of his present and former Joseph Stevens and Mason Hill customers.  The Complaint further alleged that, after he had successfully assumed the identity of his customers, Ingardia would generally, without authorization, liquidate the accounts by placing unauthorized orders to sell all or many of the stock positions it contained.  Using the cash proceeds of the liquidation, Ingardia would then place unauthorized orders to buy large quantities of penny stock in either Converge Global, Inc.

Carol C. Martino, et al.</i>, 98 Civ. 3446 (S.D.N.Y.)</h2>]","[By Order dated April 4, 2003, U.S. District Judge Milton Pollack granted summary judgment in favor of the Commission and against defendant Carol C. Martino and her former stock brokerage firm (CMA Noel, Ltd.), holding them liable for engaging in illegal brokerage activities during the period 1992 through 1995, and further holding Martino liable for engaging in a 1993 scheme to manipulate the stock price of RMS Titanic, Inc. (a company that attempted to salvage artifacts from the sunken ocean liner). The Court awarded the Commission disgorgement of Martinos illegal brokerage revenues ($4.416 million), plus prejudgement interest of $3,386,842.92, and other equitable relief.  The Court further ordered Martinos husband, relief defendant Gerard Haryman, and his company, defendant JTM Ltd., to turn over to a court-appointed receiver a $2 million luxury yacht that Martino had purchased with proceeds of her illegal brokerage activities.  The Court granted summary judgment following a hearing on the matter held on March 17, 2003., The Commission sued Martino and CMA in May 1998 for repeated violations of a 1992 Commission order that barred Martino from acting as a stock broker, and for engaging in such activities without registering as a broker with the Commission (in violation of the federal securities laws).  The Commission had barred Martino based upon her prior fraudulent activities as Executive Vice President of Wellshire Securities, Inc., a retail brokerage firm.  In its April 2 ruling, the Court found that, from 1992 through 1995, Martino willfully violated the Bar Order by illegally brokering millions of dollars in sales of stock by several U.S. companies to foreign purchasers.  The Court further found that Martino thus accumulated illegal brokerage commissions and fees totaling at least $4.416 million.  The Court ordered Martino to disgorge that sum to the Commission, plus prejudgment interest on that amount (accrued from December 31, 1995 to the present).  , The Commission further charged Martino with engaging in a scheme (along with defendant Paul Montle) to manipulate the stock price of RMS Titanic, Inc., one of Martinos U.S. brokerage clients.  The Court found that Martino and others employed several manipulative devices to maintain and increase artificially Titanics stock price during the Spring and Summer of 1993.  Martino personally participated in the schemeby (1) agreeing [with other Titanic shareholders] to control and order their sales of Titanic stock into the marketplace; (2) guaranteeing Titanics principal market maker purchasers for his Titanic stock; and (3) paying brokers to influence their clients to purchase Titanic stock.  The Court previously held defendant Paul Montle liable as well for this scheme., The Commission also charged Martinos husband, Gerard Haryman, and his company JTM, Ltd., with helping Martino to hide her illegal brokerage revenues through the purchase of a $2 million yacht called Je Taime.  In granting the Commission summary judgment on this charge, the Court found that Martino purchased the yacht in November 1997 in an attempt to hide her assets from creditors.  The Court further found that, although the yacht nominally was held by JTM, Martino had unfettered access to the Yacht since the date of purchase, and [n]o legitimate claim to the Yacht exists upon which Haryman or JTM might rely.  Consequently, the Court ordered Haryman and JTM to turn over the Yacht or its proceeds to a court-appointed receiver as partial payment of the disgorgement figure imposed on Martino and CMA., In addition, the Court permanently enjoined Martino and CMA from future violations of the federal securities laws., On January 7, 2002, in a separate criminal proceeding brought by the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Martino pled guilty to three counts of personal income tax evasion and three counts of falsely subscribing to corporate returns.  The indictment in the criminal action includes charges that Martino failed to disclose certain income, including illegal brokerage revenue that was the subject of the Commissions civil enforcement action against her.  In April 2002, Martino received a twenty-eight month sentence, which she began serving at a federal detention center in Miami, Florida.  On December 12, 2002, due to a serious illness, Martino was released from prison and is presently on supervised-release.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18072.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Goldberg, age 51, of Buffalo Grove, Illinois, for operating a Ponzi scheme that defrauded at least 130 investors out of millions of dollars.  The charges against Goldberg are the result of close cooperation between the United States Attorneys Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Commissions staff.  Both actions were filed in federal district court in the Northern District of Illinois., The Commissions complaint alleges that from at least 1988 through at least March 2002, Goldberg raised approximately $6.1 million from investors by selling six different investments.  In raising money, Goldberg misrepresented the nature of the investments and that he would use investors funds  without their permission  for his own purposes.  When the investments inevitably failed to generate the promised returns, Goldberg perpetuated the investments, just like a Ponzi scheme, by paying returns from funds raised from new investors.  , Throughout this time, Goldberg served in positions of trust to his potential and existing investors.  The Commission alleges that Goldberg raised nearly all his funds from his investment advisory clients, most recently at Essex, LLC.  Goldberg also served on the Board of Directors for two issuers for which he raised money  Stamford International, Inc. and Dauphin Technology, Inc.  In March 2002, Goldbergs scheme finally collapsed leaving his remaining investors with worthless investments., The Commissions complaint alleges that Goldberg engaged in multiple violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with his Ponzi scheme.  The Commission seeks a permanent injunction barring Goldberg from violating Sections 17(a)(1), (2), and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

In its order, the court found that the three remaining defendants in the action, Richard Brower, Mark Coates, and Tejbir Singh (Remaining Defendants), are liable for violating antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws, and that relief defendants Ana Andrescu, Jon Andrescu, and Magic Knits (Relief Defendants) are liable for receiving illegal proceeds from the fraud.  , In granting the Commissions motion for summary judgment, the court permanently enjoined each of the Remaining Defendants from future violations of the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws  specifically Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Judge Wall has scheduled a hearing on May 5, 2003 to determine the disgorgement, pre-judgment interest and civil penalty amounts.      , In its complaint, the Commission alleged that:  From at least October 1997 to at least March 1999, the defendants fraudulently raised over $2.2 million by making a litany of false statements to investors concerning a private placement in NNPD.  For example, each of the Remaining Defendants falsely represented that investors would be able to sell their NNPD shares for a substantial profit in an imminent initial public offering (IPO), when, in fact, no IPO was planned.  Most of the proceeds raised in the offering were misappropriated to pay personal expenses of the defendants.  NNPD securities were not registered with the Commission or subject to an exemption from filing., Previously, on April 5, 2001, the court entered default judgments against Allen Andrescu, Vikram Randhawa, and two companies Andrescu controlled, Renaissance Capital Management, Inc.

The Complaint alleges that Rogatinsky violated the federal securities laws in connection with the securities offering by: 1) failing to disclose that PrintontheNet was a guarantor on approximately $7.3 million in loans received by related parties; 2) failing to disclose that the largest loan underlying these guarantees (in the amount of approximately $7 million) was in default; and 3) causing PrintontheNet to file financial reports with the Commission that misstated the financial performance of PrintontheNet and one of its subsidiaries, PrintAmerica Interactive, Inc.

McClanahan and the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Texas, Matthew D. Orwig.  McClanahan was the Chairman and president of Fidelity Petroleum Corporation (FPC).   McClanahan pled guilty to a violation of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  McClanahan admitted that he falsely informed FPC investors that their funds would be pooled with other investors who had designated their funds for a similar, specific oil project, and that their funds would only be used toward that one specific oil project.  However, rather than segregate the investor funds based on oil project, McClanahan admitted to commingling all investor funds into one bank account to be used on several other FPC oil projects.  Sentencing is scheduled for August 8, 2003.  Under the statute, McClanahan faces a maximum of five years in prison. , The Commission previously filed suit against FPC and McClanahan in August 2002.

Furthermore, the defendants falsely represented that an investment in Fidelity wells would yield a yearly return of between 65% and 113% of the original investment.  The defendants had no reasonable basis for these projections at the time they made them.

According to the Commissions complaint, in May 2001, Fitts, then a director of MetroWest, tipped his friend Fabri that MetroWest was going to be acquired.  Fabri thereafter purchased MetroWest stock prior to the public announcement in June 2001 that Banknorth Group, Inc. would acquire MetroWest.  Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Fitts and Fabri consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  Fitts also agreed to pay $14,800 in civil penalties and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of any publicly-traded company.  Fabri consented to pay a total of approximately $25,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties., The Commissions complaint alleges that Fitts learned at a MetroWest board of directors meeting on May 16, 2001 of MetroWests plans to be acquired.  According to the Commissions complaint, Fitts passed this information on to Fabri during a telephone call on May 21.  That day, Fabri wrote a $20,000 check from his bank account to his brokerage account to finance the purchase of MetroWest shares.  The Commissions complaint alleges that Fitts and Fabri then spent much of the next day together, during which time they further discussed the impending takeover of MetroWest.  On May 23, Fabri purchased 3,000 shares of MetroWest.  Between May 21 and May 25, Fabri also caused another individual to purchase 325 shares of MetroWest.  On June 11, Banknorth announced its plans to acquire MetroWest, causing MetroWests stock price to rise.  According to the Commissions complaint, through his insider trading, Fabri profited by $10,710, and the other individual profited by $1,130., The Commissions complaint alleges that Fitts breached his fiduciary duty to MetroWest and its shareholders by disclosing to Fabri the material, nonpublic information concerning MetroWests acquisition, and that Fabri profited from buying MetroWest stock, and caused another person to purchase the stock, while Fabri was in possession of the material, nonpublic information.  In its complaint, the Commission charged Fitts and Fabri with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, based on their illegal insider trading.  Fitts and Fabri have each consented to entry of final judgments enjoining them fromviolating these antifraud provisions.  In addition, Fitts has consented to pay a civil penalty in an amount equal to 1.25 times the profits of Fabri and the other trader (a penalty of $14,800), and to be permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of any publicly-traded company. Fabri also agreed to disgorge his and the other traders profits (a total of $11,840), plus prejudgment interest of $1,278.65 thereon, and an additional civil penalty of $11,840 (for total payments by Fabri of $24,958.65)., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the NASD Regulation, Inc. in the matter., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18080.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18080.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Cantor, a former president and director of American Bank Note Holographics, Inc.

During the period of the alleged fraud, ABN was a publicly held holding company located in New York, New York, which, through its subsidiaries, provided, among other things, stored-value telephone cards, magnetic-strip transaction cards, printed business forms, and checks.   ABNH, located in Elmsford, New York, was, during the same period, engaged in the origination, production, and marketing of mass-produced secure holograms.  ABNH was a wholly owned subsidiary of ABN until its initial public offering in July 1998., The Complaint alleges that:, , , , , , , Cantor, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions Complaint, consented to an order permanently enjoining him from violating and/or aiding and abetting violations of the antifraud, reporting, record keeping, internal controls, and lying to auditors provisions of the federal securities laws, as well as from violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act -- Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and (B), 13(b)(5), and Section 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2.

The defendants are Freedom Golf president Gaylen P. John Johnson; Timothy J. Miles, a principal shareholder; and two promoters, Carter Allen Jones and Jonathan Curshen.  Jones company, C. Jones &amp; Company, also was charged., The complaint alleges that in the fall of 1999, Miles provided a broker-dealer with false information to be filed with the National Association of Securities Dealers in order to initiate public trading of securities issued by Freedom Golfs predecessor company.  The complaint also alleges that from late January through early March 2000, Miles paid two stock promoters, Jones and Curshen, to hype Freedom Golf via the Internet, telephone, and mail.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that Jones arranged for the dissemination of between 25 and 35 million unsolicited spam e-mails touting Freedom Golf in February 2000.  During the same period, the complaint continues, Johnson created baseless profit, revenue, and expense projections for Freedom Golf that Jones published on his companys Internet website, and that Curshen publicized on an Internet message board.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Jones and Curshen failed to disclose the full amount that Miles was paying them to tout Freedom Golf, in violation of the federal securities laws.  , The complaint further alleges that Freedom Golfs stock price and trading volume was pumped up to artificially inflated levels as a result of the false and misleading e-mails and baseless price projections.  According to the complaint, during the course of this manipulation, Jones, Miles, and Curshen all sold shares of Freedom Golf stock and reaped profits of more than $500,000.   , The Commissions complaint alleges that as a result of the conduct described above, C. Jones, Jones, Miles, Johnson, and Curshen violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and C. Jones, Jones, and Curshen also violated the anti-touting provisions of the federal securities laws.  The Commission seeks permanent injunctions, civil money penalties, and penny stock bars against each of the defendants, and the disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest against C. Jones, Jones, Miles, and Curshen.  , In a related proceeding, the Commission instituted administrative proceedings against Freedom Golf on April 7, 2003.

Matthew C. Gless</i>, Civil Action No. 03 CV 0747 W (LAB) (S.D. Cal.) (April 16, 2003)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed civil fraud charges against Matthew C. Gless, the former Chief Financial Officer at San Diego-based software company Peregrine Systems, Inc., for his participation in an eleven-quarter financial fraud at the company.  The complaint alleges that Gless and other Peregrine senior officers engaged in deceptive practices to artificially inflate Peregrines revenue and stock price, and that Gless then took fraudulent action to conceal the scheme.  , According to the complaint, the heart of the fraud was the recording of millions of dollars of revenue despite non-binding arrangements with customers, in violation of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).  At the ends of fiscal quarters, Gless schemed with other Peregrine senior officers about ways to arrange non-binding transactions with resellers (known as channel partners) and record them as revenue, so that Peregrine could meet or exceed quarterly revenue projections.  Peregrine senior officers then purported to sell Peregrines software to channel partners, even though the channel partners obligations to Peregrine were frequently contingent or subject to other terms that made revenue recognition improper.  Gless knew that senior officers were secretly adding material sale contingencies-by oral or written side agreement-to what appeared on their face to be binding contracts.  Gless also knew that senior officers were using other gimmickry to inflate the companys revenue.    , The complaint further alleges that, to conceal the revenue recognition scheme, Gless  abused the receivable financing process.  When Peregrine booked the non-binding contracts, and the customers predictably did not pay, the receivables ballooned on Peregrines balance sheet.  To make it appear that Peregrine was collecting its receivables more quickly than it was, Gless directed Peregrines senior treasury manager to sell receivables to banks and then remove them from the companys balance sheet.   There were several problems with this.  First, Gless knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that because Peregrine had given the banks recourse and frequently paid or repurchased unpaid receivables from them, Peregrine should have accounted for the bank transactions as loans and left the receivables on its balance sheet.  Second, Gless knew that some of the sold receivables were not valid because the customers were not obligated to pay.  Third, Gless knew that several of the sold invoices were fake, including one that purported to reflect a $19.58 million sale., According to the complaint, Gless also concealed the fraud by improperly writing off unpaid receivables that he knew, or was reckless in not knowing, should not have been recorded as revenue in the first place.  To make it appear to investors that the write-offs related to a non-recurring event, Gless wrote off several million dollars in uncollectible receivables to acquisition-related accounts, even though he knew the write-offs had nothing to do with acquisitions., The complaint further alleges that Gless signed false SEC filings and false management representation letters to Peregrines outside auditors, and that he responded falsely to an  SEC Division of Corporation Finance Comment Letter that inquired about Peregrines revenue recognition practice.  , According to the complaint, while Gless was aware of the ongoing fraud, he illegally sold 68,625 shares of Peregrine stock for approximately $4 million, based on material nonpublic information he possessed about Peregrines true financial condition., The Commissions complaint seeks to permanently enjoin Gless from violating certain antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws (Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5), and from violating, or aiding and abetting violations of, certain reporting, books and records, internal controls, and representations to accountants provisions (Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(5), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B), and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2).  The complaint also seeks an accounting, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, civil money penalties, and an order prohibiting Gless from acting as an officer or a director of any reporting company., In November 2002, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action against Ilse Cappel, the former senior treasury manager at Peregrine (<a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17859a.htm>Litigation Release No. 17859A</a>).  , The Commissions investigation of the financial fraud at Peregrine is continuing., The Commission thanks the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of California and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for their cooperation in this matter., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18093.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18093.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Potter of Bedford, New Hampshire, pleaded guilty to a criminal information charging him with conspiracy to commit insider trading.  Potter acknowledged that in October 2000, his son, Timothy Potter, disclosed to him confidential information about an agreement between Eli Lilly &amp; Co., Inc. and Sepracor, Inc. concerning their joint development of a  new drug.  At the time of the trade, Potters son was employed as a manager in the accounting department of Sepracor, a Marlborough, Massachusetts-based pharmaceutical company.  Potter admitted that he then used the information to trade in Sepracor securities and later transferred the resulting profit to his son.  , At the plea hearing, Potter admitted that, on October 18, 2000, his son disclosed to him material, nonpublic information relating to Sepracors relationship and agreement with Lilly. Potter further admitted that, later that day, on the basis of the information he received from his son, he purchased Sepracor put options.  When Sepracor publicly announced the termination of the agreement with Lilly the following morning, Sepracors stock price plummeted while the value of Sepracor put options soared.  Shortly after the announcement, Potter sold the Sepracor put options, generating an overnight profit of more than $55,000.  He admitted that he later transferred that profit to his son.  Potter also admitted that he made false and misleading statements to the Commission staff during its investigation into his trading.  , Potter will be sentenced on July 22, 2003.

The civil and criminal actions allege that the officers engaged in fraudulent conduct that resulted in the overstatement of L90s revenues to the public in 2000 and 2001.  Each of the defendants settled the Commissions action without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  , The Commissions civil complaint, filed today in United States District Court in Los Angeles, alleges that John C. Bohan, L90s former CEO, president, and member of L90s board of directors; Lucrezia Bickerton, L90s former vice president of finance; Mark D. Roah, L90s former senior vice president of business development and member of L90s board of directors; and Chantel J. Loo, L90s former controller and director of finance, engaged in a scheme to generate false revenues through fraudulent barter transactions with other Internet companies in order to meet stock analysts revenue estimates.  To generate revenue from these barter transactions, L90 swapped checks with the other companies or round-tripped cash through more than one third party.  The essence of the round-trip transactions was a circular flow of money by which L90 improperly recognized revenue., The Justice Departments criminal action, also filed this morning in federal court in Los Angeles, charges Bohan with criminal securities fraud.  Bickerton and Roah are charged with being part of a conspiracy to commit securities fraud in connection with L90s fraudulent scheme.  Roah also is charged in a separate conspiracy to fraudulently inflate the revenues of Homestore.com, Inc.  As a participant in that conspiracy, Roah is charged with orchestrating round-trip transactions involving Homestore, L90 and other companies, which enabled Homestore fraudulently to recognize its own cash as revenue.  In the process, a company controlled by Roah received over $650,000 cash.  , Bohan, Bickerton, and Roah have agreed to settle the Commissions lawsuit, to plead guilty to the criminal charges, and to cooperate with the government in the ongoing investigation.  Loo, who was not charged in the criminal case, has agreed to settle the Commissions lawsuit., The Commissions complaint alleges that the primary scheme to inflate revenues involved ten barter transactions that L90 fraudulently recorded on its books.  In five of these transactions, L90 agreed to exchange Internet advertising on its proprietary website, webMillion.com, with one other company, swapped checks of identical or similar amounts with the same company, and improperly recognized revenue on the money received in the exchange.  In five other transactions, L90 agreed to exchange advertising on webMillion.com with at least one other company, engaged in the round-tripping of money through at least two other companies, and improperly recognized revenue on money received from the round-tripping.  These transactions included two round-trip transactions with Homestore in which L90 recognized $500,000 in revenue.  In a second revenue-generating scheme, L90 improperly booked revenue for a large advertising campaign despite the fact that Bohan and Bickerton knew that L90 would never receive payment for the campaign.  Through these fraudulent practices, L90 overstated its revenues from Q3 2000 through Q3 2001 by at least $4.9 million, or 9.2%, and by as much as 29% in one quarter.  L90 was thereby able to meet analysts revenue estimates in all but one quarter., The Commissions complaint charges Bohan, Bickerton, Roah, and Loo with securities fraud, lying to the auditors, falsifying L90s books and records, circumventing L90s system of internal accounting controls, and aiding and abetting L90s reporting violations.  The Commission also charged Roah with aiding and abetting the fraudulent reporting of inflated Homestore revenues by certain of Homestores employees., The individuals charged, their alleged violative conduct, and terms of their plea agreements and settlements are:, , , , , In a related matter, the Commission today also announced that it ordered MaxWorldwide, Inc., formerly L90, Inc., to cease and desist from violating the reporting, record keeping, and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws.  The Commission found that L90 materially overstated its revenues in 2000 and 2001 as a result of the improper barter transactions and advertising campaign and that L90 misclassified approximately $26 million of its research and development expenses in 2000 and 2001.  L90 consented to the entry of the order without admitting or denying the Commissions findings.  , The civil case is the product of an ongoing investigation by the Commission.  The criminal case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.,  , <!--<IMG SRC=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=9 ALT= BORDER=0>  <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18100.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>--><!-- End text -->,  ]"

A face-amount certificate company is a specialized type of investment company that issues fixed-income debt securities, agreeing to pay the principal amount of the instruments plus accrued interest on maturity., The Honorable Catherine C. Blake, upon motion of the Commission, entered emergency relief, including a temporary restraining order and freeze of payments to certificate holders, against the defendant, and scheduled a hearing on the Commissions motion for appointment of a receiver for May 5, 2003, with a preliminary injunction hearing to be scheduled thereafter., The Commissions complaint charges 1st Atlantic with violating Sections 28(a) and 28(b) of the Investment Company Act, and seeks permanent injunctive relief.  The complaint alleges that, from at least September 2001 to the present, as a result of the transfer of certain assets previously held by it, 1st Atlantic has been and is operating with reserves well below the legal minimum required by the Investment Company Act.  Between 1998 and 2002, the former chief executive officer and chairman of 1st Atlantic diverted approximately $1 million from 1st Atlantic and transferred assets with a value of more than $2.8 million to a subsidiary without consideration., The complaint further alleges that, in an attempt to cover its reserve deficiency, in September 2001, 1st Atlantic began to improperly count the value of the common stock of its subsidiary, State Bond and Mortgage Company, LLC (State Bond) as a qualified investment.  However, the stock of State Bond is not a qualified investment, as defined under the Investment Company Act and, therefore, cannot be counted by 1st Atlantic towards its reserve requirement.  Without that asset, 1st Atlantic has qualified investments of only $450,000 to pay certificate liabilities of more than $4 million and is operating in violation of the reserve requirements.  Under the terms of the certificates, holders are entitled to demand immediate redemption (with a small penalty) and investors who seek immediate payment could dissipate the remaining assets of the company to the detriment of other investors.

Brian Adley et al. </i>(United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts C.A. No. 03-10762 MEL)   </h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Chancellor Corporation, a Boston MA transportation equipment company, four of the companys former senior officers, a former outside director, the companys audit firm and the audit firms engagement partner with securities fraud.  The action, filed in federal court in Boston, alleges that from 1998 through 2001, Brian Adley, Chancellors former Chairman, CEO and controlling shareholder, orchestrated a scheme to inflate Chancellors reported assets, revenue and profits using fabricated documents and fraudulent accounting.  Former officers of the company named as defendants in the civil suit were Chancellors former President and Chief Operating Officer, Franklyn E. Churchill, its former acting Chief Financial Officer and consultant, David C. Volpe, and Jonathan Ezrin, who variously served as the companys Principal Accounting Officer, Corporate Treasurer and Controller.  Also named as defendants were a former director of the company, Rudolph Peselman, BKR Metcalf Davis, an Atlanta GA accounting firm that served as Chancellors auditors from 1999 to 2001, and Gregory Davis, a partner and CPA at the firm. Simultaneously with the filing of the Commissions civil action, Chancellor Corporation, Volpe and Ezrin entered settlements with the Commission.  The Commission also instituted and simultaneously settled administrative cease and desist proceedings against Michael Marchese, a second outside director of Chancellor, and against David Decker, a member of the audit team who performed the year-end audit for Chancellors 1998 results, and Theodore Fricke, who served as the concurring partner for the audit.    , The Commission charges that Adley caused Chancellor to file false financial statements in 1999 and 2000 by directing the wholesale fabrication of corporate documents, by instructing that the fabricated documents be given to the companys auditors, and by coordinating the filing of false financial statements with the Commission.  Former officers Churchill, Volpe and Ezrin allegedly participated in the scheme by assisting with the preparation of, and in some instances signing, false, fabricated or misleading financial documents.  According to the suit, Peselman, a member of the Board of Directors Audit Committee from June 1999 to October 2001, violated antifraud provisions of the securities laws by signing a number of false financial statements and, as an outside director with fiduciary responsibilities, by ignoring clear warning signs that financial improprieties were ongoing at the company and by failing to ensure that the companys public filings were accurate.    , The Commission further charges that Gregory Davis and his firm, BKR Metcalf Davis, which became Chancellors auditors when Adley and Churchill fired an initial audit firm after the firm refused to report suspect financial results and information proposed by Adley, enabled the fraudulent scheme to proceed by conducting deficient audits of the companys financial statements, by falsely representing in public filings that Chancellors financial statements were presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and by failing to detect and report likely violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws by Chancellor.  Gregory Davis, the concurring partner on the Chancellor audits performed by his firm, oversaw and signed the deficient, misleading audit reports.  , <b><u>Relief Sought</u></b>, With respect to the relief being sought, the Commission seeks final judgments of permanent injunction and other relief enjoining each of the defendants from violating or aiding and abetting violations of the anti-fraud and periodic reporting provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13, and additionally as to Chancellor, Adley, Churchill and Volpe, Rule 13a-11, which requires prompt and accurate disclosure of material events in Commission filings.  Additionally as to the Chancellor defendants, the Commission seeks injunctions from violations of the record-keeping and internal controls provisions, Sections 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and, as to the individuals, 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rules 13b2-1, and additionally as to Adley, Churchill, Volpe and Ezrin, Rule 13b2-2, which prohibits officers of a company from lying to auditors.  The Commission also seeks to enjoin Metcalf Davis and Davis from violating Section 10A of the Exchange Act, which requires auditors to take adequate steps to detect and report suspected fraud by management of companies they audit. In addition, the Commission seeks an order requiring Adley to disgorge at least $1.1 million in improper payments he caused Chancellor to make to an entity he controlled, and the value of a $3.71 million interest-free loan he improperly obtained by diverting proceeds of a business loan to Chancellor to his own account.  The Commission also seeks disgorgement by Churchill of his compensation from Chancellor, and by Davis and BKR Metcalf Davis of the $120,000 in fees they received for their services to Chancellor.   The Commission seeks civil monetary penalties from each of those individual defendants and from Metcalf Davis.  It also seeks an order permanently barring Adley, Churchill and Peselman from acting as officers or directors of any public company.    , <b><u>Settled Actions</u></b>, Chancellor Corporation, Volpe and Ezrin entered settlements with the Commission in which, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions Complaint, they consented to entry of permanent injunctions against violations of the anti-fraud, reporting, record-keeping and internal controls provision of the federal securities laws.  Volpe and Ezrin each agreed to pay a $25,000 civil monetary penalty, with the amount of Volpes penalty  based on Volpes sworn representations in financial statements submitted to the Commission.  , Marchese, without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, consented to anorder requiring him to cease and desist from committing or causing any violation, and any future violation, of the anti-fraud, periodic reporting, record keeping and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20 and 13a-1.  Marchese was a director of Chancellor from 1996 to June 1999.  The Commission found that Marchese acted recklessly in signing Chancellors Form 10-K for 1998, which contained materially misleading financial statements, and did not fulfill his responsibility as a director to ensure that Chancellor maintained accurate books and records and adequate internal controls.  , In addition, Decker and Fricke consented to an order pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commissions Rules of Practice, suspending them from appearing or practicing before the Commission as accountants and providing that Decker may apply for reinstatement after three years and Fricke after two years.  The order also  requires them to cease and desist from committing or causing any violation, and any future violation, of  Sections 10A and 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18104.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  ]"

The SECs Complaint alleged that from January 1999 through October 1999, Bockler drafted and disseminated at least one dozen glowing reports about Global containing baseless price projections and making BUY and STRONG BUY recommendations while, at the same time, selling his own shares of the Companys stock.  Moreover, Bockler never disclosed in his reports the compensation he was paid by Global, or that he was selling his Global stock.

McMullin was charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice during an SEC enforcement investigation of Reed E. Slatkin, making false statements to FBI and IRS agents, and making false statements under oath to the bankruptcy trustee for the Slatkin estate.  From approximately 1986 until May 2001, Slatkin operated a massive Ponzi scheme in which he solicited more than $593 million from approximately 800 investors.  McMullin, 38, of Santa Barbara, has agreed to plead guilty to the charges when he is arraigned in May., In his plea agreement, McMullin admitted that when the SEC began a formal investigation of Slatkins activities in 1999, McMullin and Slatkin conspired to obstruct the SECs investigation.  McMullin and Slatkin, among other things, lied to the SEC by minimizing McMullins role in, and knowledge of, Slatkins bogus investment activities.  McMullin also lied to FBI and IRS agents by minimizing his own actions and knowledge of Slatkins Ponzi scheme.  Moreover, McMullin lied during sworn testimony to the attorney for the court-appointed bankruptcy trustee for Slatkins estate.  McMullin did not disclose to any of the federal investigators the huge disparity between what Slatkin told investors and his actual investment portfolio.  Between 1986 and August 1999, McMullin received nearly $2 million in salary and bonuses from Slatkin, and he netted approximately $952,000 from his personal investment account with Slatkin.  McMullin has agreed to pay over $1.5 million in restitution to Slatkins victims., On May 11, 2001, the SEC obtained a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against Slatkin in federal district court in Los Angeles.  The Commission alleged that Slatkin defrauded hundreds of clients through his unregistered investment advisory business located in Santa Barbara, California.   ,  On June 7, 2001, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a Judgment of Permanent Injunction against Reed E. Slatkin. The judgment enjoins Slatkin from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the investment adviser registration provisions of Section 203(a) of the Advisers Act.  Slatkin, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, consented to the entry of the injunction.  Slatkin has also been barred by the Commission from associating with any investment adviser., The U.S. Attorneys Office for the Central District of California charged Slatkin with 15 felony charges, including mail and wire fraud, money laundering and conspiracy to obstruct justice during an SEC enforcement investigation.

The remainder will be paid to resolve related proceedings by state regulators.  In the SEC action, J.P. Morgan has agreed to a federal court order that will enjoin the firm from future violations of NASD and NYSE rules and require the firm to make changes in the operations of its equity research and investment banking departments.  In addition, J.P. Morgan will pay, over five years, $25 million to provide the firms clients with independent research, and $5 million to be used for investor education. , In connection with this matter, the Commission today filed a Complaint against J.P. Morgan in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging violations of NASD and NYSE  rules.  According to the Commissions Complaint, from at least July 1999 through June 2001, research analysts at J.P. Morgan were subject to inappropriate influence by investment banking at the firm.  The Complaint also alleges that J.P. Morgan made payments to other firms for those firms to publish research on J.P. Morgans underwriting clients without ensuring that such payments were disclosed and failed to maintain appropriate supervision over its research and investment banking operations., Specifically, the Commissions Complaint alleges that:  , , , Given how thoroughly we just got screwed on IRF, [the head of research at J.P.

Weve been screwed too many times . . . . (Emphasis in original.), , , , J.P. Morgan has agreed to settle the Commissions action and has consented, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint, to the entry of a final judgment that, if approved by the court, permanently enjoins J.P. Morgan from violations of NASD and NYSE rules pertaining to just and equitable principles of trade (NASD Rule 2110; NYSE Rules 401 and 476), advertising (NASD Rule 2210; NYSE Rule 472), and supervisory procedures (NASD Rule 3010; NYSE Rule 342).  The final judgment also orders the firm to make the payments described above, and provides for the appointment of a fund administrator who, subject to court approval, will formulate and administer a plan of distribution for those monies placed into the distribution fund.  , In addition, the final judgment orders J.P. Morgan to implement structural reforms and provide enhanced disclosure to investors, including a broad range of changes relating to the operations of its equity research and investment banking operations.  J.P. Morgan has agreed to sever the links between research and investment banking, such that:  research and investment banking are physically separated with completely separate reporting lines; analysts compensation cannot be based directly or indirectly upon investment banking revenues; investment bankers may no longer evaluate analysts; investment bankers will have no role in determining what companies are covered by the analysts; and research analysts will be prohibited from participating in efforts to solicit investment banking business, including pitches and roadshows.  In addition, J.P. Morgan must disclose on the first page of each research report whether the firm does or seeks to do investment banking business with that issuer, and when J.P. Morgan decides to terminate coverage of an issuer, J.P. Morgan must issue a final research report discussing the reasons for the termination.  Each quarter, J.P.

Kasarjian and The Kenton Group, Inc. f/k/a Kenton Portfolio Management, Inc.</i>, 97 Civ. 2516 (JES)(SDNY), <b>BENNETT FUNDING GROUP OFFICER AND COMPANY HE CONTROLLED CONSENT TO SETTLE SEC FRAUD CHARGES AGREE TO BAR FROM OFFERING UNREGISTERED SECURITIES</b>, The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced today that Kenneth P. Kasarjian (Kasarjian), formerly an executive of The Bennett Funding Group, Inc. (BFG), and The Kenton Group, Inc. (Kenton), a company Kasarjian owned, have agreed to settle the Commissions enforcement action pending against them in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  The settlement, which remains subject to court approval, resolves the action in which the Commission charges that Kasarjian and Kenton played instrumental roles in a massive Ponzi scheme perpetrated by BFG and its former chief financial officer, Patrick Bennett.  In the settlement, Kasarjian and Kenton have consented to the entry of a final judgment that not only enjoins them from committing further violations of the securities laws, but also bars them from again participating in the offer or sale of unregistered securities.  , In its complaint, the Commission alleged that, between 1990 and 1995, Kasarjian fraudulently offered and sold over $810 million of unregistered securities to investors while he was senior vice president of BFG and a registered representative of a broker-dealer wholly owned by BFG.  Kasarjian, through Kenton, sold investments in purported office equipment leases that did not exist or that already had been assigned to others.  The Commission also alleged that Kasarjian and Kenton distributed materially false BFG financial statements in connection with the sale of promissory notes to the public and, from approximately October 1995 through March 1996, sold membership interests in four investment funds by falsely representing that the funds would invest in particular types of income-generating obligations of BFG.    , Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Kasarjian and Kenton consented to a final judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1993 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.  That final judgment, if approved by the court, will also bar the defendants from ever again offering or selling unregistered securities professionally to investors. Specifically, it will permanently enjoin Kasarjian and Kenton from participating in an unregistered offering while acting as, on behalf of, or in association with, an issuer, underwriter, broker, or dealer.  , On April 10, 1997, in a parallel action brought by the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York, Kasarjian pleaded guilty in federal court to criminal charges in connection with the fraudulent scheme and agreed to pay $900,000 from the sale of his home to BFGs bankruptcy estate.  On July 19, 2000, Kasarjian was sentenced to two years imprisonment and ordered to pay $100,000 in restitution to the BFG estate.  In addition, Kasarjian has given the BFG estate an additional $300,000 in proceeds from the sale of his home, $129,641 from his sale of certain securities, and certain other stock holdings.    , For more information, see Litigation Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr14875.txt>14875</a> (April 15, 1996), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr14991.txt>14991</a> (July 26, 1996), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr15324.txt>15324</a> (April 10, 1997) and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr15398.txt>15398</a> (June 26, 1997). , <!--<IMG SRC=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=9 ALT= BORDER=0>  <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18119.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>--><!-- End text -->,  ]"

Neil R. Cole, Civil Action No. 03 CV 3021 (RMB), <p align=CENTER>SEC FILES ACTIONS AGAINST CANDIES, INC., CANDIES CEO, AND <br/>SEVERAL FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS ALLEGING FINANCIAL FRAUD, Today, the Commission filed a complaint in the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and instituted administrative cease-and-desist proceedings, alleging that Candies Inc., Neil R. Cole, Candies Chief Executive Officer, and other former directors and members of Candies senior management were involved in financial fraud.  The complaint and orders instituting cease-and-desist proceedings allege that from August 1997 until the spring of 1999, Candies senior management employed various fraudulent accounting practices designed to improve Candies publicly reported financial condition.  Candies, Cole, and other former officers and directors of the company have consented to the entry of injunctions and cease-and-desist orders, without admitting or denying the allegations.   , The cease-and-desist orders name the following respondents:, , , , , The complaint in the injunctive action names the following defendants:, , , , , Specifically, the complaint and/or cease-and-desist orders allege the following.  Candies senior management, including OShaughnessy, Klein and Golden primarily employed two fraudulent accounting practices.  First, OShaughnessy directed employees to engage in a practice known as bill and hold that allowed Candies to prematurely record revenue from various purchase orders calling for future delivery of shoes, by recording these orders as final sales prior to shipping the shoes to customers.  Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) do not permit revenue recognition for sales unless risk and title has passed to the customer, which typically occurred only when Candies shipped shoes to customers.  In fact, Candies own revenue recognition policy called for recognition of revenue upon shipment of goods with risk and title passing.  Despite the prohibitions of GAAP and its own policy, Candies prematurely recognized over $4.4 million in revenue in fiscal years 1998 and 1999 through the improper use of bill and hold and other irregular shipping practices.  Brown, who was in charge of customer service, played a crucial role in carrying out the bill and hold practice.  Golden and Klein were aware that Candies was engaged in the bill and hold practice and permitted Candies to report the resulting revenue and income in its Forms 10-K and 10-Q.  Cole ignored red flags that Candies was engaged in this practice and failed to prevent  the company from recognizing revenue from this improper practice., Second, Candies improperly recognized over $3.1 million in revenue from two illusory sales transactions with a barter company that Levi controlled.  In these transactions, which were purportedly entered into in August 1997 and October 1998, Candies claimed to sell shoes to the barter company in exchange for a combination of cash and advertising credits.  The revenue and income that Candies recorded in connection with these transactions was improper because Candies either never shipped the shoes described by the contracts underlying these transactions, or Candies shipped the shoes many months after recording the revenue.  OShaughnessy and Klein negotiated and/or signed the barter agreements with Levi.  Golden was aware of at least one of these agreements.  After Candies auditors raised questions about these transactions, OShaughnessy, Golden and Levi provided the auditors with false information about Candies purported sales of shoes to the barter company., Finally, Candies recorded several unsupported journal entries in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1999 to recognize approximately $1.65 million in sales credits from one of its overseas buying agents.  Tucker agreed to permit Candies to record the credits and assisted Candies in obtaining falsified documentation of the credits.    , As a result of these fraudulent accounting practices, Candies falsely inflated its reported financial results for numerous fiscal quarters, including the quarter ended October 31, 1997, the fiscal year ended January 31, 1998, and for the quarters ended April 30, 1998, July 31, 1998, and October 31, 1998.  Additionally, Cole recklessly authorized a misleading press release that preannounced fiscal year 1999 earnings at a time when he and others at Candies knew that the companys auditors were refusing to sign-off on Candies financial statements because of a variety of questions they had about the barter transactions and sales credits., The complaint and/or cease-and-desist orders charge Candies, OShaughnessy, Golden, and Klein with primary violations of the antifraud provisions as well as with primary or aiding and abetting reporting violations, books and records violations and internal control violations.   The complaint and/or orders also charge Brown, Levi and Tucker with aiding or abetting or causing Candies violations of the antifraud provisions as well as reporting violations.  Finally, a cease-and-desist order charges Cole with causing violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, as well as causing certain violations of  the reporting provisions, and falsifying certain of Candies books and records., Specifically, the cease-and-desist orders charge:, Candies with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A)&amp;(B) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13 and 13b2-1;, Cole with causing violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20 and 13a-13, and with violating Rule 13b2-1;, Golden with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2, and causing violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A)&amp;(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13;  and, Brown with causing violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13., The complaint charges:, OShaughnessy with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2, and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) &amp; (B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13; , Klein with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1; and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) &amp; (B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13; ,  Tucker with violations of Section 13(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-2, and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, and 13a-1; and, Levi with aiding and abetting violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13. , Cole and Brown consented to the entry of cease-and- desist orders without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations.  Cole has also agreed to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $75,000.   OShaughnessy, Tucker and Levi consented to the entry of injunctions without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations.  OShaughnessy has agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000 and consent to an officer and director bar. Tucker has agreed to pay a civil penalty of $25,000, disgorgement of $10,000 in directors fees he received from Candies in fiscal year 1998 and 1999, interest, and consent to a five year officer and director bar. Levi has agreed to pay a $25,000 civil penalty.  , Candies and Golden also have consented to the entry of cease-and-desist orders without admitting or denying the allegations.

Altman Agree to Pay</b><br/><b>Over $1 Million to Settle Charges</b>, On April 30, 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a complaint against two former stockbrokers, Ethan H. Weitz of Manalapan, Florida and Robert R. Altman of New York, New York, for illegal short selling in advance of secondary or repeat stock offerings.  Simultaneously with the filing of the SECs action, Weitz and Altman, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, agreed to settle the charges against them by consenting to the entry of an order that they:  1) pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties totaling more than $1 million; 2) be enjoined from further violations of certain statutes and rules that govern short selling; and 3) be prohibited from participating in any future secondary or repeat stock offering.  , The SECs complaint alleges that starting in August 1999 and continuing until June 2002, Weitz and Altman illegally profited by selling securities short in advance of repeat and secondary stock offerings in violation of the federal securities laws.  Their activity began shortly before the New York Stock Exchange barred Weitz and Altman from associating with its members after it found that they had illegally traded ahead of, or along with, orders placed by customers. , The SECs complaint alleges that Weitz and Altman sold securities short in advance of fifteen repeat and secondary offerings within five days of the pricing of the offered securities, and covered their short sales with securities that they purchased in the offerings.  By doing so, Weitz and Altman violated Rule 105 under Regulation M of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which is designed to prevent manipulative conduct in advance of stock offerings.  The complaint also alleges that on numerous occasions they sold securities short at prices that were below the price at which the last sale in the security had been effected.  This practice is prohibited by Section 10(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10a-1 thereunder, which are designed to prevent short selling in a declining market.  According to the complaint, by trading in violation of these statutes and rules, Weitz and Altman profited by $511,367.39.  , The Order to which Weitz and Altman consented permanently enjoins them from future violations of these short selling provisions, and orders them to disgorge, jointly and severally, the $511,367.39 that they profited from their illegal trading, plus prejudgment interest.  The judgment also orders them to pay civil money penalties of $255,683.70 each, for a total of $511,367.39.  In addition, Weitz and Altman have consented to the entry of a limited trading ban that prohibits them from purchasing securities in any repeat or secondary offering.  , The SEC wishes to thank the New York Stock Exchange and its staff for their assistance in investigating this matter., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18121.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  ]"

Rice, former chief executive officer, Joseph Hirko, former chief executive officer, Kevin P. Hannon, former chief operating officer, Rex T. Shelby, a former senior vice president, and F. Scott Yeager, a former senior vice president, of Enron Broadband Services, Inc. (EBS), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Enron Corp., with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws., The Amended Complaint alleges that Rice, Hirko, Hannon, Shelby and Yeager engaged in a wide-ranging fraudulent scheme to, among other things, inflate the value of Enron stock through a series of false and misleading statements and the omission of material information in such public statements about the technology, financial condition, performance and value of EBS.  The false and misleading statements took the form of press releases over a two-year period as well as presentations and statements made at Enrons annual analyst conference in January 2000 and 2001.  The false statements sought to distinguish the capabilities of the Enron Intelligent Network (EIN), Enrons broadband network, from other networks by claiming that it contained built-in intelligence - a software control layer called the Broadband Operating System or the BOS - that allowed it to perform more sophisticated applications than other networks.  The BOS and its predecessor, InterAgent, however, did not work as Enron claimed and the EIN was unable to perform the applications that were represented it could perform.  In addition, Rice and Hannon made false statements and material omissions concerning the value of Enrons broadband business and its commercial success at the January 2001 analyst conference.    , As a result of the false statements Enrons stock was artificially inflated.  Rice, Hirko, Hannon, Shelby and Yeager then sold large amounts of Enron stock at the inflated levels, at a time when they knew that the statements were false and misleading and when they were in possession of material non-public information concerning the true status of the technology and EBS commercial success.  The unlawful profits were substantial:  Hirko -- $53.0 million; Rice -- $40.3 million; Yeager -- $35.1 million; Shelby -- $17.5 million; and Hannon -- $9.0 million. , The Amended Complaint charges Rice, Hirko, Hannon, Shelby and Yeager with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission is seeking disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains, civil money penalties, a permanent bar from acting as an officer or director of a publicly held company, and an injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws., This action amends the Complaint filed against Kevin A. Howard and Michael W. Krautz, two former EBS executives, on March 12, 2003.  That Complaint as well as the Amended Complaint alleges that Howard and Krautz engaged in a sham transaction, known as Project Braveheart, which caused Enron to overstate its reported net income for the year 2000 by $53 million and for first quarter 2001 by $58 million.  The Amended Complaint alleges that the fictitious net income generated through Project Braveheart was an integral part of a broader fraudulent scheme to deceive the public about EBS.  , The Commission brought this action in coordination with the Justice Departments Enron Task Force, which today filed related criminal charges against Rice, Hirko, Hannon, Shelby and Yeager., The Commissions investigation is continuing.

Harrington entered a final judgment against the defendants on April 21, 2003. , On January 31, 2000, the Commission filed a Complaint against Cheal (d/b/a Relief Enterprise) and relief defendant Birmingham, alleging that Cheal violated the general antifraud and securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws (Sections 5(a) and (c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder).

Ryan, who settled the action, is the President and CEO of Standard Power and Light (Standard), an Oakbrook, Illinois corporation., The Commissions Complaint alleges that, on November 30, 2001, Ryan filed a notice with the SEC and issued a press release publicly announcing plans by Standard, a company with no revenues or substantial assets, to commence a tender offer to purchase the majority of shares of Enron, an acquisition which Ryan expected to cost approximately $750 million to $1 billion.  The Complaint also alleges that Ryan attempted to convince investors that his plan to purchase Enron was legitimate by asserting, both in a November 30 press release, and in subsequent statements to the press during the first week in December 2001, that he had firm financing commitments, including $300 million, in place to complete the tender offer, and was imminently forming a management team to further the acquisition.  In fact, neither Ryan nor Standard had the financial means or commitments to commence or complete the tender offer, and had failed to arrange for anyone to be on a management team.  Ryan thus made materially false public statements regarding the tender offer for Enron, and made these statements without the intent to commence the tender offer within a reasonable time, or to complete the offer, and without the reasonable belief that Standard had the means to purchase Enron securities to complete the offer.

Patterson, the former chairman and chief executive officer of Tulsa-based Nesco, Inc., a former Nasdaq company once recognized by Fortune Small Business Magazine as one of Americas 100 fastest growing small companies (OTC: NESCQ)(Nesco or the company).  The SEC charged Patterson with financial fraud and other securities law violations related to his orchestration of a false invoice scheme that inflated Nescos assets and revenue for its fiscal year 2000 and first quarter 2001 by over $2 million.  This action was brought in close coordination with the U. S. Attorneys Office in Tulsa, Oklahoma and the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation Division, which simultaneously announced Pattersons indictment and arrest on related criminal securities fraud charges and bank and tax fraud charges.  Patterson, age 59, resides in Bixby, Oklahoma., According to the SECs complaint, Patterson was Nescos chairman and CEO at all relevant times until August 16, 2001, when the companys board of directors forced him to resign.  Assisted by Nescos now deceased former controller, Patterson grossly overstated the companys earnings by booking 28 bogus customer invoices totaling $2,153,986 in the fourth quarter of 2000 and one invoice totaling $183,385 in the first quarter of 2001.  These false invoices resulted in overstatements to Nescos pretax income for those periods of 400% and 175%, respectively.  Nesco included these false figures in its annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC.  The complaint further alleges that Patterson, who had borrowed heavily to acquire large amounts of Nesco stock, devised the fraudulent scheme to conceal the companys dismal financial performance from investors, bolstering Nescos share price and preventing his personal financial ruin., The SEC alleges that Patterson created the majority of the false invoices in January 2001 and backdated them to December 2000 to permit their inclusion in Nescos 2000 financial results.  The invoices reflected false accounts receivable that were not due to Nesco and were completely unrelated to services actually performed by the company or billed to its customers.  The resulting phantom revenue and assets, however, were included in Nescos fiscal year 2000 financial statements.  The complaint further alleges that Patterson lied to Nescos auditor to prevent discovery of the scheme during its audit of the companys 2000 fiscal year.  The complaint also alleges that Patterson included these fictitious invoices in the financial statements contained in Nescos Form 10-KSB, which he signed and filed with the SEC on behalf of Nesco on April 2, 2001., According to the complaint, Nescos management became suspicious of the companys financial statements for the 2000 fiscal year and commenced an internal investigation in May 2001.  This investigation ultimately revealed Pattersons fraud and caused Nesco to compel his immediate resignation from the company on August 16, 2001.  Further, Nesco voluntarily issued a press release disclosing its financial overstatements, restated its financial results for its fiscal year 2000 and first quarter 2001, and continued its internal investigation to ensure that it had uncovered the whole scheme and any other financial mismanagement.  Nesco also fully cooperated with the SEC in its investigation of the matter., Nescos continuing internal investigation revealed a number of additional material misstatements in the companys financial statements as a result of inadequate internal controls. First, Nesco overstated revenue from work in process by $923,244.  Second, Nesco overstated lease-contracts receivable by $460,466, due to a recording error.  Finally, Nesco overstated other accounts receivable by an additional $575,252, as a result of a recording error and a failure to write off uncollectible accounts.  These misstatements, combined with the bogus-invoice scheme, overstated Nescos 2000 pretax income by over 840%., The specific charges brought by the SEC against Patterson include securities fraud, circumventing internal controls, falsifying books and records, lying to auditors, and violations of periodic reporting and books and records requirements, in violation of, or aiding and abetting violations of, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2), and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2.  In its complaint, the SEC requests that Patterson be permanently enjoined from future securities violations, that a civil monetary penalty be assessed against him, that he be ordered to disgorge the full amount of compensation he received from Nesco during the relevant period, including salary and bonuses, with prejudgment interest, and that he be barred from serving in the future as an officer or director of a public company., On May 7, 2003, the SEC also announced the institution of cease-and-desist proceedings against Nesco based on the aforementioned misconduct.  The SEC simultaneously accepted Nescos offer to consent to a cease-and-desist order.  The order, in charging violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder, orders Nesco to cease and desist from committing or causing any future violations of the above books and records, reporting, and internal controls provisions., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18125.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  ]"

Fla., Filed May 6, 2003), <p align=CENTER>SEC Brings Settled Enforcement Actions against Andrx Corp.  , The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced today that it filed settled enforcement actions against Andrx Corp. in connection with alleged accounting improprieties that occurred at Andrx and its Internet subsidiary, Cybear, Inc.  Andrx has consented, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations against it, to pay a civil penalty of $100,000 in a civil action filed in federal district court, and to the entry of an order (Order) by the Commission that it cease and desist from certain violations of the issuer reporting, books and records and proxy provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act).    , The Commissions case arises from accounting improprieties in connection with a joint venture between Andrx and Cybear to sell Andrx distributed products over Cybears website, and books and records violations regarding Andrxs accounts receivable balances between 1999 and 2002.  More specifically, the complaint in the Commissions civil action (as well as Order in the related cease-and-desist proceedings) alleges that during the first two quarters of its fiscal year ended December 31, 2000, Cybear improperly recognized as Internet revenue telephone orders taken by Andrx telemarketers.  According to the Commissions complaint, telephone orders for Andrx distributed products that should have been recognized by Andrx were instead input onto Cybears Internet website by Cybear employees and recognized by Cybear as revenue.  In some instances, Cybear employees input orders onto the Internet for customers who did not have Internet access or a computer.  The complaint alleges that these orders accounted for a majority of Cybears reported revenues during the relevant time periods.  According to the Commissions complaint, Cybears recognition of these revenues was not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  , The Commissions complaint further alleges that the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&amp;A) section of Cybears periodic filings with the Commission did not adequately disclose Cybears revenues.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that in July 2000, after senior management of Cybear and Andrx learned that Andrx telemarketing orders were being entered onto Cybears website, Cybear described these sales as revenues derived from orders placed through the Internet in its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2000.  Cybear also did not provide sufficient information regarding its revenues in a proxy solicitation sent to shareholders in connection with a corporate reorganization and tracking stock plan that created a separate tracking stock for Cybear. , The Order in the related cease-and-desist proceedings against Andrx also finds that between 1999 and the quarter ended March 31, 2002, Andrx filed financial statements with the Commission that overstated Andrxs net accounts receivable, and understated the related provision for doubtful accounts, by an aggregate of approximately $5.4 million.  This conduct resulted from the unauthorized actions of an Andrx employee, but led to violations by Andrx of the books and records and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws.  In August 2002, after learning of these improper entries, Andrx promptly reported them to the Commission staff and disclosed them in a press release and Commission filing., Based upon the conduct alleged in the complaint, the civil action alleges that Cybear violated Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2) and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-13 and 14a-9 thereunder.  The complaint also alleges that during the course of the Commissions investigation of Cybears misconduct, Cybears cooperation with the Commissions inquiry was at times less than complete.  Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Andrx has agreed to pay a $100,000 penalty based on Cybears violations in order to settle the civil action.  , In the related cease-and-desist proceedings, the Commission ordered Andrx to cease and desist from committing or causing any violation and any future violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2) and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-13 and 14a-9 thereunder, and ordered Scott Lodin, Andrxs general counsel, to cease and desist from causing any violations and any future violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-13 and 12b-20 thereunder.  The Commission also issued a separate order against Timothy E. Nolan, the former president and chief operating officer of Cybear, which ordered him to cease and desist from causing any violations and any future violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-13 and 12b-20 thereunder.  ,  ]"

Martinez., In pleading Damato admitted, among other things, that from June 2000 to February 2002 he falsified the company records and press releases of Eagle Building, the stock of which is publicly traded under the symbol EGBT.  Specifically, Damato created fraudulent bank account statements and purchase orders and diverted privately invested funds to Eagle Building to create the false appearance of substantial revenue to Eagle Building from sales and operations in India.  He also caused false quarterly and annual reports to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Damato also caused misleading press releases to be issued about testing and capabilities of a surveillance system by Biosterile Technologies, Inc., a company represented by Eagle Building.

According to the Commissions complaint, Gray raised $5.1 million from investors worldwide by offering interests in a non-existent Asset Management Program.  Gray instead pocketed the money, using investor funds to, among other things, buy a new car and travel to Europe.  The United States District Court for the Eastern District of California has issued an order freezing all assets held by Gray and Metropolis.    In a complaint filed May 1, 2003, the Commission alleges that Gray, a Fresno home builder, told investors that he would use their funds to invest in a $100 million Leased Asset Management Instrument promising substantial returns.  He further claimed to have obtained an insurance policy guaranteeing the safety of their investments.  The Commissions complaint alleges that Grays representations were entirely false.  Gray did not put any money into the supposed investment instruments, nor did he procure any sort of insurance protecting investor funds.  Rather, Gray deposited investor funds into a standard brokerage account, withdrawing hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash for himself.  The Commission further alleges that Gray spent tens of thousands of dollars of investor funds on trips to Europe, New York, and Las Vegas, a car, jewelry, computers and electronics, and other personal items., In addition, the Commissions papers show that, upon learning of its investigation, Gray lied to the Commission about the whereabouts of investor funds.  Even after agreeing to freeze investor funds pending the Commissions investigation, Gray attempted to wire funds from an account he had concealed from the Commission into his lawyers bank account.

Evans (Evans), a New York attorney, with engaging in illegal insider trading.  In its complaint, the Commission alleges that Evans purchased Periphonics Corporation (Periphonics) stock from June 1999 through July 1999 while in possession of material non-public information concerning the acquisition of Periphonics by Nortel Networks Corporation (Nortel), and Evans sold Hirsch International Corporation (Hirsch) stock in September 1997 while in possession of material non-public information concerning negative projections of Hirschs estimated quarterly earnings.  Evans, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, consented to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to disgorge his gains from the illegal trades and imposes a civil penalty that is equal to two times the amount of Evans trading profits in Periphonics stock., Evans, age 66, was a partner in the law firm of Ruskin, Moscou, Evans &amp; Faltischek, P.C., n/k/a Ruskin, Moscou, Faltischek, P.C. (the Law Firm) at the time the violations occurred, and resigned from the Law Firm on June 1, 2002.  Periphonics and Hirsch were clients of the Law Firm., The complaint alleges the following.  Between June and August 1999, the Law Firm represented Periphonics in confidential negotiations that led to the merger of Periphonics and Nortel.  Evans participated in numerous meetings concerning the merger negotiations.  As an attorney, Evans had a fiduciary duty to keep confidential the information he learned from clients in the course of the Law Firms representation.  In addition, Evans had a fiduciary duty to refrain from using confidential information obtained from a client for his own advantage or benefit without the clients consent.  Between June 18 and July 1, 1999, in breach of the duties he owed to Periphonics and its shareholders, Evans purchased 19,800 shares of Periphonics stock on the basis of material non-public information concerning the merger.  On August 24, 1999, Periphonics and Nortel announced the merger between the two companies and the price of Periphonics stock rose approximately 10% to close at $27.75 per share.  As a result of his unlawful purchases of Periphonics stock, Evans made at least $221,762.50 in illicit profits., During 1997, the Law Firm was outside legal counsel for Hirsch.  From August 1997 through September 8, 1997, Evans participated in confidential meetings and discussions with Hirsch officers and employees about Hirschs financial condition, including its estimated earnings for the third quarter of its 1998 fiscal year (the Estimated 1998 Earnings), which were expected to be well below analysts projections.  On September 2 and September 3, 1997, in breach of his fiduciary duties, Evans sold his 6,125 shares of Hirsch stock in advance of the public announcement of the Estimated 1998 Earnings based on the material non-public information Evans acquired.  Additionally, prior to September 4, 1997, Evans tipped a family member who owned Hirsch stock with the material non-public information he had obtained concerning the Estimated 1998 Earnings.  On September 4, 1997, the Tippee sold 6,000 shares of Hirsch stock based on the material non-public information he acquired from Evans.  On September 8, 1997, Hirsch issued a press release announcing that its estimated earnings for the third quarter of its 1998 fiscal year would be $.08 to $.10 below analysts projections.  On September 9, 1997, the price of Hirsch stock decreased approximately 20% to close at $17.875 per share.  As a result of their unlawful sales of Hirsch stock, Evans avoided losses of $40,562.50 and the Tippee avoided losses of $40,375.00., Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint, Evans consented to the entry of a final judgment: (1) permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (2) ordering him to disgorge $302,700 in illegal profits and to pay prejudgment interest of $107,174.93; and (3) ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $443,525, which represents two times the amount of his illegal profits in Periphonics stock.,  ]"

The Courts judgment against Epstein and Alliance permanently enjoin each of them from future violations of the stock sale reporting provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 13(d) and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 13d-1, 13d-2 and 16a-3 thereunder.  The judgments also order Epstein and Alliance to disgorge $618,230 in ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and order Epstein to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $25,000., In its complaint, filed August 7, 2002, the SEC alleged that EyeCashNetworks predecessor, eConnect (OTCBB:  ECNT), and its former president - Thomas S. Hughes, age 53, of Rancho Palos Verdes, California - issued false and misleading press releases and posted false statements on eConnects websites in July 2002.  These statements concern a purported $20 million investment of AA rated bonds that in fact were not rated, a nonexistent stock repurchase program and a purported $964,000 purchase order for eConnects principal product.  In addition, the SECs complaint alleged that:, In its complaint, the Commission charged:  Hughes with violating the antifraud and insider transactions reporting provisions of the federal securities laws (Sections 10(b) and 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 16a-3 thereunder); (2) eConnect with violating the antifraud provisions of the securities laws (Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder); and (3) Epstein and Alliance with violating the insider transactions and stock sale reporting provisions of the federal securities laws (Sections 13(d) and 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13d-1, 13d-2 and 16a-3 thereunder).  The Commission also seeks civil penalties, and an officer and director bar against Hughes.  The litigation against Hughes is continuing., In August 2002, Hughes was indicted for his 2002 conduct by a grand jury impaneled by the United States Attorneys Office for the Central District of California on seven criminal charges, including three counts of securities fraud under the Exchange Act, three counts of wire fraud and one count of criminal contempt.  <i>United States v.

The Complaint alleges that for almost two years, from August 1998 to May 2000, Thomassen made repeated fraudulent misrepresentations on the Internet for the purpose of manipulating the stock price of at least nine microcap companies.  According to the Complaint, Thomassen sent numerous fraudulent unsolicited spam e-mail messages touting the stock and business prospects of each of the companies.  Using several aliases, the Complaint further alleges, Thomassen also posted false and misleading information about these microcap companies on the Silicon Investor and Raging Bull websites.  The Complaint alleges that, after the dissemination of the false information, the stock price and trading volume of many of the issuers increased significantly in the short term.  According to the Complaint, on three occasions, Thomassen quickly sold his personal stock holdings in these companies into the resulting inflated market.  The Complaint alleges that through his trading in the issuers stocks, Thomassen realized illegal profits of $8,302, which constituted a return on his original investment of between 32% to 132% depending upon the particular stock., The Commissions Complaint seeks a judgment against Thomassen: (i) permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), specifically Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act; (ii) permanently barring him from any future participation in the offering of penny stocks, under Section 603 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; (iii) ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains Thomassen received as a result of his wrongful conduct, plus pre-judgment interest thereon; and (iv) awarding civil monetary penalties., For tips on how to avoid Internet pump-and-dump stock manipulation schemes, visit <a href=/investor/online/pump.htm> http://www.sec.gov/investor/online/pump.htm</a>, For more information about Internet fraud, visit <a href=/divisions/enforce/internetenforce.htm>http://www.sec.gov/divisions/enforce/internetenforce.htm</a>. , To report suspicious activity involving possible Internet fraud, visit <a href=/complaint.shtml>http://www.sec.gov/complaint.shtml</a>.<br/><br/><img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18137.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18137.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Company filed for bankruptcy protection in 1999.  Gilburne consented to the entry of an injunction against him, civil penalties, and an officer and director bar., The Commissions complaint alleges that from at least 1997 through its 1999 demise, Just for Feet substantially overstated its assets and income through the use of bogus receivables from the Companys outside advertising agency.  One such receivable of $3 million comprised 8.7% of Just for Feets $34.2 million in reported pre-tax income in its Form 10-K annual report for fiscal 1997.  A second bogus receivable of $5.3 million comprised 12.3% of Just for Feets $43.3 million in reported pre-tax income in its Form 10-K annual report for fiscal 1998., According to the complaint, Gilburne made or directed fraudulent adjustments in Just for Feets financial records necessary to artificially inflate Just for Feets earnings. In or around January 1998, a senior management official, Gilburne and others caused a false credit memorandum for $3 million from the advertising agency to be entered into Just for Feets books and records. On December 15, 1998, Gilburne agreed with the senior management official and the advertising agency president that the advertising agency would grant Just for Feet a rebate of $5.3 million for fiscal 1999.

(PPA) and its chairman, Lloyd Benton Sharp, a recidivist violator who has an extensive disciplinary history, including a criminal conviction and two federal court injunctions for fraud on investors.  According to the complaint, Sharp conducted his latest scam under the name of PPA, which he claimed was a non-profit organization created to assist investors, particularly retirees and senior citizens, in finding safe and secure investments providing heightened returns.  In approximately October 2002, Sharp and PPA commenced publicly offering interest in a limited partnership that supposedly would grow and market paulownia trees.  PPA and Sharp represented that the investment was extremely safe (comparing it to gold in Fort Knox) and would provide a very secured 16% annual return because it had an iron clad $81.8 million contract with another company to purchase the matured trees.  , In reality, according to the SECs complaint, the PPA offering was a complete sham.  Among other things, the third party company obligated to purchase $81 million in trees was controlled by Sharp and had no funds or assets with which to purchase the trees.  Further, undisclosed to investors, approximately 42% of investor funds were earmarked for commissions and management fees.  Sharp and PPA also failed to disclose to investors Sharps extensive disciplinary history involving investment fraud., According to the complaint, the SEC staff learned of the fraudulent PPA offering in late January 2003, and by that time, two investors had invested approximately $86,000 in the PPA offering.  At the SECs staffs insistence, Sharp and PPA halted the offering and returned all investor funds., Simultaneous with the filing of the SECs complaint, PPA and Sharp consented to the entry of an order of permanent injunction for violations of the securities-registration, broker- and dealer-registration, and anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Stewart owns and controls Stewart Finance and Stewart National, both of which are consumer finance companies headquartered in Union Point, Georgia.  The complaint alleges that the defendants conducted unregistered offers and sales of securities, without an exemption from registration, in violation of the federal securities laws.,  The Commissions complaint alleges that in 1989, Stewart Finance commenced a continuous series of offerings to Georgia investors of its subordinated debentures and senior demand notes, and in 1998, Stewart Finance sold preferred stock to Georgia investors.  According to the complaint, although the initial offers and sales of securities by Stewart Finance were purportedly exempt from registration pursuant to the intrastate offering exemption set forth in Section 3(a)(11) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), by 1999, Stewart Finance could no longer rely on that exemption and was, in fact, engaging in unregistered offers and sales of securities without an exemption from registration.  The complaint alleges that in or about August 1999, after learning that Stewart Finance could no longer issue securities, Stewart began personally issuing promissory notes to investors and transferring the proceeds of those notes to Stewart Finance.  The complaint further alleges that the offers and sales of Stewarts promissory notes were not registered with the Commission and were not exempt from registration.  Moreover, the complaint alleges that in January 2002, Stewart National began offering $25 million in variable rate subordinated debentures in a purported private placement pursuant to Regulation D of the Securities Act.  The Stewart National offering was not exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act because the facts and circumstances of the offering required it to be integrated with the prior and contemporaneous non-exempt offerings by Stewart Finance and Stewart., According to the complaint, the offerings of Stewart, Stewart Finance and Stewart National were a single offering because:  (1) the offerings were part of a single plan of financing and were made for the same general purpose of funding the consumer finance businesses owned and operated by Stewart; (2) Stewart Finance and Stewart National each offered the same type of securities  subordinated debentures; (3) Stewart Finances, Stewarts and Stewart Nationals offerings overlapped during the same time period; and (4) the offerings all involved the same type of consideration  cash.  Further, the complaint alleges that Stewart Finance and Stewart National are integrated issuers because, among other things, they are under common ownership and control and are engaged in the same business, and the success of both Stewart National and Stewart Finance is dependent upon the same individual  Stewart., The complaint alleges that by their conduct, Stewart, Stewart Finance and Stewart National violated the registration provisions set forth in Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.

Skooglund had served as the companys Vice President of Finance and Chief Accounting Officer from November 1992 to January 2000.  The Commissions lawsuit charged Skooglund and three other executives with fraudulently inflating the companys earnings during 1998 and 1999 in order to meet their previously announced quarterly projections.  In the second half of 1999, when news of Sabrateks inflated operating results began to emerge, its market capitalization declined by approximately 98%., Skooglund, a resident of Woodridge, Illinois, agreed to pay a civil penalty of $35,000 and also to pay disgorgement plus interest totaling $15,923.97, reflecting bonuses that he received during the period in which the Commission claims that Sabratek was cooking its books.  Skooglund also agreed to the entry of a permanent injunction barring him from future violations of anti-fraud, record-keeping, and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws, contained in from violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-1, and 13b-2-2 thereunder.  The court order reflecting this settlement was entered on May 14, 2003., All of the other defendants named in the Commissions lawsuit  previously settled the Commissions claims against them.  Kuldershan S. Padda, the founder and former CEO of Sabratek, agreed to pay $125,000 in civil penalties. Stephen Holden, the companys Chief Financial Officer, Controller and Treasurer from August 1996 to July 1998 and its President and Treasurer from July 1998 to January 2000, agreed to disgorge bonuses (plus prejudgment interest) in the amount of $68,376 and a civil penalty of $90,000.  Stephan C. Beal, the companys Vice President of Sales, agreed to disgorge bonuses and commissions totaling $29,237 (plus prejudgment interest of $6,193) that he received during the 1998-1999 period, and to pay a civil penalty of $60,000.  Padda, Holden and Beal also agreed to the entry of permanent injunctions., In the lawsuit, the Commission alleged that the defendants engaged in a scheme to overstate Sabrateks sales and results of operation in its Form 10-K for the year 1998 and Forms 10-Q for the first three quarters of 1998 and the first quarter of 1999.  According to the Complaint, the scheme was carried out to enable Sabratek to meet inflated revenue expectations that Sabrateks senior management had created., The Complaint alleged that, from the first quarter of 1998 through the first quarter of 1999 the defendants recognized numerous large, end-of-the-quarter transactions that did not qualify as sales under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).  In some instances, the defendants allegedly created fictitious sales of pumps that had not been ordered by customers, but instead were parked at third-party warehouses.  In other instances, they allegedly entered into sales agreements containing consignment or right-of-return provisions.  In still other instances, they allegedly agreed to significant sellers obligations, including promises that Sabrateks sales force would assist Sabrateks customers in the resale of these pumps to end-users.  The Commission also alleged that throughout 1998 and the first quarter of 1999, the defendants inflated Sabrateks sales by billing another company a total of $4.5 million for consulting services that Sabratek executives in fact largely never provided., The Commission alleged that over the five quarters from the first quarter of 1998 through the first quarter of 1999, Sabratek, through the defendants actions, overstated net sales by $30.7 million, or more than 60%.  The Commission also alleged that through the defendants actions, Sabratek reported total operating income of $10.3 million, when in fact had experienced an operating loss of $8 million over the five quarters in question.  In the second half of 1999, when news of Sabrateks inflated operating results began to emerge, the companys market capitalization declined by $202.5 million, or 98%.  On December 17, 1999, Sabratek filed a petition to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18142.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

This amount constitutes all of the commissions that Mechlenburg received in connection with her introduction of investors to this fraudulent program  The court also imposed a $120,000 civil penalty on Mechlenburg, and issued a permanent injunction prohibiting future violations of anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, contained in Sections 17(a)(1), (2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act)[15 U.S.C. §77q(a)(1), (2) and (3)] and Sections 10b-5 and 15(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) [15 U.S.C. §§78j(b) and 780(c)] and Rules 10b-5 and 15c1-2 thereunder [17 C.F.R. §§240.10b-5 and 240.15c102].  The Court also permanently enjoined Mechlenburg from acting as an unregistered broker or dealer, pursuant to Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§780(a)]., The SECs enforcement action, which was commenced on November 19, 2001, arises out of a fictitious investment program that Dowdell operated through Vavasseur Corporation, a Bahamian company controlled by Dowdell.  Investors in this program (the Vavasseur Program) were required to sign an investment contract with Vavasseur Corp., termed a Discretionary Investment Management Agreement (Agreement).  The agreement falsely represented that investor funds would be maintained in a bank account registered as Vavasseur Corp. for the benefit of (Client name), and committed Vavasseur: to use its best efforts to achieve anticipated profits. . . in an amount equal to or exceeding Four Percent (4%) of the Clients funds under management for each week in which trading occurs.  [Vavasseur] shall use its best efforts basis to cause trading of Clients funds in a minimum of forty weeks during each fifty-two week Agreement term.  This would result in annualized gross return of 160%., As Dowdell now admits, there were no trades or investments made by Vavasseur, but rather investors were paid profits in a typical Ponzi scheme fashion from new investor funds diverted to Dowdells AmSouth accounts.  In the course of perpetrating this fraud, millions of dollars of investors funds were misappropriated by Dowdell and the marketers of the Vavasseur Program., Mechlenburg was one of the principal marketers for the scheme, raising more than $13 million from investors in the United States and Europe.  She was also the first investor in the program, having deposited $20,000 with Dowell in late 1996.  Mechlenburg immediately began receiving checks from Dowdell each week, along with a cover letter stating that these payments constituted trading profits.  By 1998, when Mechlenburg began actively marketing the program, she was able to produce to potential investors a track record of personal success in the program. In reality, however, Dowdell was not paying Mechlenburg any trading profits, but merely returning her $20,000 investment in small, weekly increments.  In the judgment against Mechlenburg, the Court made numerous findings against her, including that she was reckless in recommending the program to investors.  As the Court noted in its judgment order, this is not the first time the Mechlenburg has been sanctioned for violating the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  Only months before she commenced her association with Dowdell in late 1996, the SEC had issued an Administrative Order barring her from association with any broker or dealer.  That Order stemmed from Mechlenburgs participation in a similar fraudulent trading program., Mechlenburg is not currently residing in the United States, having fled the country shortly after Dowdell admitted to the fraud in June 2002, taking her assets with her.  In a prior order, Court entered contempt findings against Mechlenburg in connection with this expatriation of assets. The SEC requests that anyone with knowledge of Mechlenburgs current whereabouts contact the Receiver appointed in this lawsuit at the website address listed below., Additional information concerning the SECs lawsuit against Dowdell can be found in <u><a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17242.htm target=_top>Litigation Release No. 17242</a></u>, November 19, 2001; <u><a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17454.htm target=_top>Release No. 17454</a></u>, April 2, 2002; <u><a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17553.htm target=_top>Litigation Release No. 17553</a></u>, June 10, 2002; <u><a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17780.htm target=_top>Litigation Release No. 17780</a></u>, October 10, 2002; <u><a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17881.htm target=_top>Litigation Release No. 17881</a></u>, October 10, 2002; and <u><a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17905.htm target=_top>Litigation Release No. 17905</a></u>, December 19, 2002, <u><a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17999.htm target=_top>Litigation Release No. 17999</a></u>, February 26, 2003, <u><a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18029.htm target=_top>Litigation Release No. 18029</a></u>, March 11, 2003., Additional information on how prime bank and other banking-related investment schemes work can be found at the SECs Prime Bank Fraud Information Center (<u><a href=http://www.sec.gov/divisions/enforce/primebank.shtml target=_top>http://www.sec.gov/divisions/enforce/primebank.shtml</a></u>) in the enforcement section of the SECs Web site, at the Receivers website, located at <a href=http://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/goodbye.cgi?www.dowdell-receivership.com target=_top>www.dowdell-receivership.com</a>.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18143.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The false releases materially impacted Concentraxs stock price and volume, and resulted in the SEC temporarily suspending trading in Concentraxs stock on November 22, 2002.   According to the complaint, Concentrax falsely announced that it had contracts to sell its tracking system to three nationally known companies, including a vehicle-leasing company, an oil and gas drilling company and a mechanical engineering firm.  In fact, Concentrax had no contracts to sell the system to any of these companies.  The complaint also alleges that the company made misleading earnings projections in two of its press releases that were based in part, on the purported sales contract with the major vehicle-leasing firm.  Finally, the complaint alleges that Concentrax raised approximately $560,000 in a private stock offering during the period that it was issuing the false and misleading press releases., Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint, Concentrax and Gifford consented to the entry of a permanent injunction for violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Potter of Bedford, New Hampshire, pleaded guilty to a criminal information charging him with conspiracy to commit insider trading.  Potter acknowledged that in October 2000, he disclosed to his father, George R. Potter, confidential information concerning adverse corporate developments at Sepracor, Inc. that related to a drug then being jointly developed by Eli Lilly and Company and Sepracor.  At the time, Potter was employed as a manager in the accounting department of Sepracor, a Marlborough, Massachusetts-based pharmaceutical company.  Potter admitted that his father then used the information to trade in Sepracor securities and later transferred the resulting profit to him., At the plea hearing, Potter admitted that, on October 18, 2000, he told his father about the adverse corporate developments at Sepracor.  Potter further admitted that, later that day, on the basis of the information he gave to his father, his father purchased Sepracor put options.  The following morning, when Sepracor publicly announced the termination of its agreement with Lilly concerning the new drug, Sepracors stock price plummeted while the value of Sepracor put options soared.  Shortly after the announcement, George Potter sold the Sepracor put options, generating an overnight profit of more than $55,000.  Potter admitted that his father later transferred that profit to him.  Potter also admitted that he made false and misleading statements to the Commission staff during its investigation into his fathers trading., Potter will be sentenced on August 18, 2003.  On April 18, 2003, George Potter, also of Bedford, New Hampshire, pleaded guilty to a criminal information charging him with conspiracy to commit insider trading.

Calif).</h2>, <h2>Court Imposes $534,408 of Disgorgement, Prejudgment Interest, and Civil Penalty against Former UCLA Student and Relatives in Internet Stock Manipulation Case.</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on May 12, 2003, The Honorable Consuelo B. Marshall, Chief Judge for the United States District Court for the Central District of California, issued a final judgment imposing a total of $534,408.72 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against a defendant and two relief defendants in an internet stock manipulation case.  Judge Marshall ruled for the Commission after a trial on the issue of monetary relief.  In her ruling, Judge Marshall rejected the defendant and relief defendants arguments that the Court should reduce the amount of any disgorgement award by the amount of income taxes they had paid on their ill-gotten gains and by the decline in the value of the assets in several of their frozen brokerage accounts., The defendant is Refael Shaoulian, a twenty-six year-old graduate of UCLA.  The relief defendants are Samuel Shaoulian and Rabin Shaoulian, Refael Shaoulians father and brother, respectively.      , The Commission had charged in its complaint that while Refael Shaoulian was a student at UCLA he and others had manipulated the prices of five microcap stocks by posting hundreds of false messages about the stocks on internet bulletin boards and chat rooms.  The Commission charged that in connection with each of those five stocks, Refael Shaoulian bought shares of the stock; used false screen names and publicly available computers at locations on the campuses of UCLA and other universities to post hundreds of false, favorable messages about the stock on internet bulletin boards and chat rooms, thereby causing the price of the stock to rise; and then sold his shares for a profit.  The Commission further charged that in connection with some of the stocks, Refael Shaoulian later sold shares short; posted negative messages about the issuer on the internet; and then covered his short position after the price of the stock had fallen.  , The Commission alleged that through this conduct Refael Shaoulian had violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission further alleged that Refael Shaoulian had transferred to his father and brother profits that he had obtained through his fraud.  Refael Shaoulian had previously consented to the entry of a permanent injunction against future violations of Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.  , The case was tried to the Court on the issues of what monetary relief should be imposed against the Shaoulians.  The Commission charged that Refael Shaoulian had obtained $410,111.34 of illicit profits through his fraud, and that the Shaoulians had commingled those profits among twenty-one bank and brokerage accounts they controlled.  The Commission alleged further that the three Shaoulians had used the profits from Refael Shaoulians stock manipulations to finance further stock trading and to pay personal and business expenses.   The Commission asked the Court to order the Shaoulians jointly and severally to disgorge $410,111.34 of illegal gains together with prejudgment interest, and to impose a civil penalty against Refael Shaoulian., The defendant and the relief defendants did not contest the amount of profits that Refael Shaoulian had obtained from the conduct at issue.  However, they maintained that in the calculation of any disgorgement award they should be given credit for income taxes they had paid on the ill-gotten gains.  They also argued that they should be given credit for the amount by which the value of the assets in several of their brokerage accounts had declined after the accounts were frozen by the Court.  , Judge Marshall rejected the defendants arguments.  With respect to the decline in the value of their brokerage accounts, the Judge ruled that in a Commission enforcement action the amount to be disgorged by a defendant is the entire amount of the defendants ill-gotten gains, and that there are no exceptions for situations in which a defendants assets have declined after a court-ordered asset freeze.  As for the defendants income taxes, Judge Marshall ruled that the use of illegally obtained funds to make expenditures for a defendant is to be counted against the defendant, precisely because he or she benefited from those expenditures. , Judge Marshall ordered the defendant and the two relief defendants jointly and severally to pay $410,111.34 in disgorgement, together with $114,297.38 in prejudgment interest.  The Judge additionally ordered Refael Shaoulian, who is unemployed, personally to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.  , Contact: John E.

The proposed settlement, which is subject to the approval of both the District Court hearing the Commissions action against WorldCom and the Bankruptcy Court handling WorldComs bankruptcy case, provides for a judgment in the Commissions action requiring WorldCom to pay a civil penalty of $1,510,000,000.  As a result of the companys pending bankruptcy case, the proposed settlement provides for satisfaction of the Commissions judgment by WorldComs payment, after review and approval of the terms of the settlement by the bankruptcy court, of  $500,000,000.  Under the terms of the proposed settlement, the funds paid by WorldCom in satisfaction of the Commissions judgment will be distributed to victims of the companys fraud, pursuant to Section 308 (Fair Funds For Investors) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002., Today the District Court reserved decision on the settlement, and issued an order  requiring the parties to provide more information about a number of issues.  The order further invites any others with interest in the case to file written comments with the Clerk of the District Court by 5 p.m. on June 6, 2003.  The Court will convene a conference with the parties on June 11 at 4 p.m. to discuss where the case should go from there, and will not approve a settlement before that date.  The Court will not, however, accept oral presentations from non-parties., The Commission has alleged that WorldCom misled investors by overstating its income from at least as early as 1999 through the first quarter of 2002, as a result of undisclosed and improper accounting.  (<a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17829.htm>Litigation Release No. 17829</a>).  The Commission filed its case against WorldCom on June 26, 2002, the day after WorldCom announced that it intended to restate its financial results for five quarters-all quarters in 2001 and the first quarter of 2002.  (Litigation Release No. 17588).  The Commission also sought the appointment of a corporate monitor for WorldCom, and on July 3, 2002, U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff appointed former SEC Chairman Richard Breeden to that position.  Since the Commission filed its action against WorldCom, the company has made a series of announcements expanding its anticipated financial restatement due to the fraud, both in dollar amount and in time.   WorldCom has acknowledged that, as a result of undisclosed and improper accounting, it materially overstated the income it reported on its financial statements by approximately $9 billion., On November 26, 2002, the Commission obtained a judgment against WorldCom through which the Commission obtained the full injunctive relief it sought against WorldCom.  In addition, the judgment ordered WorldCom to undertake extensive reviews of its corporate governance and internal controls, as well as required WorldCom to establish a training and education program for WorldCom officers and employees to minimize the possibility of future violations of the federal securities laws.  The November 26, 2002 judgment explicitly left open the determination of monetary penalties to be imposed on WorldCom.  (Litigation Release No. 17866)., In addition, the Commission has brought civil actions against four former employees of WorldCom.  The Commission filed civil actions against former WorldCom Controller David F. Myers on September 26, 2002; former WorldCom Director of General Accounting Buford Buddy Yates, Jr., on October 7, 2002; and Betty L. Vinson and Troy M.

The Commission alleged that Carvajal, who had been managing his parents investments, learned of the merger negotiations in the course of his employment and capitalized on that information on behalf of his parents, Alonso and Beatriz Carvajal of Bay Shore, New York, who gained $10,491.52 in illicit profits. , The Commission also announced that it has reached a settlement with Carvajal.  Carvajal has consented, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions Complaint, to the entry of a final judgment that (1) permanently enjoins Carvajal from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, (2) orders Carvajal to disgorge the $10,491.52 in profits and to pay prejudgment interest in the sum of $923.35, and (3) orders Carvajal to pay a civil penalty of $20,983.04, a sum that is equal to twice his parents ill-gotten gains.   The Commission has submitted the proposed final consent judgment to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York., The Commissions Complaint alleges as follows:, On or about May 31, 2001, Carvajal learned from another high-ranking officer that Hotjobs.com was involved in confidential negotiations to be acquired by TMP Worldwide.  On June 7, 2001, he used cash in a money market fund in his parents joint brokerage account to buy 2,000 shares of Hotjobs.com shares in anticipation of a price increase at the time the transaction was announced.  He also liquidated securities in his fathers individual retirement account to purchase 120 shares of Hotjobs.com, also in anticipation of a price increase at the time of the public announcement.  Carvajals parents, who had given him trading authority in their accounts, did not learn of the purchases until they received their monthly account statements.  On June 29, 2001, TMP Worldwide announced its plans to acquire Hotjobs.com, causing the stock price to jump approximately 19 percent.  Carvajal sold the shares he bought for his parents and realized a profit of $10,491.52 in their two accounts.

The Complaint alleges that Freeman gave non-public information on the pending deals to James Cooper in an Internet chat room.  Cooper tipped several persons, including his broker, Conner.  Conner traded in advance of one transaction and realized profits of $2,752.  Conner also provided tips to several persons who traded and realized profits of $3,581,573 collectively.  One of the persons tipped by Conner was his client, Allen.  Allen purchased securities in advance of sixteen transactions and realized profits of $895,713.

In addition, the court appointed a receiver to take possession of Mobleys and his hedge funds assets, to search for hidden assets, and to redistribute funds to defrauded investors.  In July 2001, in a related action brought by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Middle District of Florida, Mobley pleaded guilty to eight felony counts for his fraudulent scheme, was sentenced to seventeen and a half years imprisonment, and was ordered to pay $76.2 million in restitution.  Mobley is currently in prison., In the settlement announced today, Mobley consented, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations,  to the entry of a final judgment that (1) permanently enjoins him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5; and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and (2) orders him to disgorge $38.96 million, with that obligation deemed satisfied by Mobleys previous disgorgement of that amount of funds and other assets to the receiver.  Also today, with Mobleys consent, the Commission issued an order barring him from being associated with any investment adviser, pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940., The Commission thanks the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for its assistance in this case.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18150.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Williams, and Timothy C. Olk, both of Texas., The Commission charges that Greenline, its president, Williams, and its sales agent, Olk, fraudulently raised over $2.1 million from approximately 25 investors, most of them elderly or retired, by selling them investment contracts in the form of limited partnership interests from April 1998 through July 2000., The Commissions complaint alleges that, in connection with the offering, Greenline, Williams and Olk made false and misleading statements to investors regarding the use of investor funds, and the liquidity, potential returns and risks associated with the investment.  In particular, according to the Commissions complaint, Williams and Olk told investors that Greenline would generate annual returns ranging from 12-16% by using 82% of the investors funds to purchase discounted used automobile notes.  In reality, the Commission alleges that no more than 30% of investors funds were actually used to purchase auto receivables, and Williams and Olk used the vast majority of investor funds to enrich themselves and pay personal and business expenses.  Moreover, according to the Commissions complaint, Williams and Olk failed to disclose that investor funds were used to make Ponzi payments to earlier investors.  Williams and Olk, both licensed insurance agents, promoted the Greenline interests as liquid investments, assuring investors that they could liquidate their investments at any time during the term of the investment with 30-day notice.  In reality, according to the Commissions complaint, the investments were a sham, and the assurances of liquidity were false, inasmuch as only $541,000 of the $2.1 million invested has been returned to the investors., The Commissions complaint charges that Greenline, Williams and Olk violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint also charges that Olk violated Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.

Goldberg, age 51, of Buffalo Grove, Illinois, pled guilty to two counts of mail fraud for selling a series of investments that defrauded approximately 130 investors out of more than $8 million.  Goldberg entered the plea before the Honorable Milton I. Shadur, Senior United States District Court Judge for the Northern District of Illinois.  Goldberg is scheduled to be sentenced on June 18, 2003.  Goldberg faces a maximum ten year prison sentence, and could be ordered to pay $500,000 in fines and more than $8 million in restitution to the victims of his fraud.  , Goldberg admits to fraudulently raising funds from investors, many of whom were his investment advisory clients at Essex, LLC.  In raising money, Goldberg misrepresented the nature of the investments and that he would use investors funds - without their permission - for his own purposes.  When the investments inevitably failed to generate the promised returns, Goldberg perpetuated the investments, just like a Ponzi scheme, by paying returns from funds raised from new investors., One such investment that Goldberg admits was a fraud was the Stamford Escrow.  Beginning in July 2000, Goldberg raised more than $1.7 million from forty-three investors purportedly to fund an escrow account required by Canadian law to complete a merger of a Canadian company and a high-tech American company.  Goldberg represented that investors would receive stock in the merged companies when the merger was finalized.  Goldberg further represented that investors funds were refundable at any time because their money was in an escrow account in Canada.  In reality, no such escrow account existed.  Instead, Goldberg used investors money to make payments to investors in an earlier investment called HCC Funding and to fund a land development project in Long Grove, Illinois called Acacia Ventures.  As a result, all forty-three Stamford Escrow investors lost their entire investment., Goldbergs guilty plea came just three weeks after the United States Attorney filed criminal mail fraud charges and the Securities and Exchange Commission civil securities fraud charges against him.  The Commissions action against Goldberg is pending before the Honorable Rebecca R. Pallmeyer, United States District Court Judge for the Northern District of Illinois.

Peitz, Benson and Paladino were also convicted of six counts of money laundering and one count of money laundering conspiracy.

Through Lennox alone, the defendants collected more than $11 million.

In fact, the purported trading program did not exist and investor funds were not used to trade banking instruments.

The press release was materially false and misleading because Amplidyne did not have this new set of products available for sale.  Specifically, Amplidyne had not even obtained two of the three essential components that comprised the new set of products.  Amplidyne was weeks, if not months, away from being able to assemble, field-test, demonstrate and ship the new set of products to customers.  In addition, Amplidyne could not legally offer to sell or even market the new set of products under Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations., The Complaint alleges that after the press release was issued on September 9, 1999, Amplidynes stock price more than tripled, rising to $10.25 relative to the previous days closing price of $3.125.  Trading volume in Amplidyne stock also increased dramatically, rising from 211,500 shares traded the day before the press release, to more than 17 million shares traded on September 10, 1999.  , The Commissions Complaint also alleges that Bains, during CNBCs Squawk Box program on September 14, 1999, falsely stated that the new set of products had been successfully field-tested over a 50-mile distance and that Amplidyne was ready to sell it.  In reality, Amplidyne had never field-tested the products, there was no evidence that the products would work as Bains claimed, and Amplidyne did not have a finished set of products ready to sell. , Simultaneously with the filing of the Complaint, Amplidyne and Bains, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining both from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Among other things, the Court found that CRG failed to disclose either its compensation from the issuers for promoting the securities or that CRG was selling its positions in those same securities while promoting the companies to the public.  The promotions were published in publications such as <i>Money World</i>, <i>Confidential Fax Alert</i>, <i>The Rumor Mill</i> and <i>Growth Industry Report</i>, all owned and operated by the defendants., The Court found that the Veitia Defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Court held the Veitia Defendants failed to disclose they were being paid for promoting the stock of CRGs clients or that they were profiting from their recommendations by selling their holdings while recommending that investors buy such stocks.  These omissions were material and fraudulent, the Court concluded., The Court also found that the Veitia Defendants violated Section 17(b) of the Securities Act, which prohibits a person from publishing any article describing a security for consideration without fully disclosing the receipt and amount of such consideration, on the ground that the Veitia Defendants disclosures were insufficient under the statute.  In doing so, the Court rejected the defendants contention that the promoted companies disclosed this information in public filings they made with the Commission, finding that the plain language of Section 17(b) obligates the person who published the article to make the disclosure., The Court also found that Veitia, CRG and Stratcomm violated Section 5 of the Securities Act by selling securities issues that were not registered with the Commission and were not subject to any exemption from registration.  The Court concluded these defendants controlled two Costa Rican entities, Fondo de Adquisiciones E Inversiones Internacionales XL, S.A. (Fondo) and C.A. Oportunidad, S.A. (Oportunidad), and misrepresented these entities to their issuer-clients as legitimate foreign purchasers to whom stock could be sold under Regulation S without registration.  The Court found that sales to these entities were de facto sales to the defendants and that the defendants did not establish the availability of any exemption for such sales., The Court further held that CRG violated Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act by acting as an unregistered broker.  CRG directed its sales force to contact registered representatives and encourage them to pitch the securities of CRGs clients to their customers.  Then, once the customer bought the security, CRGs sales personnel would submit proof of the purchase to CRG and collect compensation based upon the transaction.  Similarly, the Court found that CRG and Stratcomm violated Section 15(a) by acting as an unregistered dealer.  The Court determined that CRG acted as a dealer by buying and selling securities for its own account through its Costa Rican nominees, Fondo and Oportunidad, and that Stratcomm acted as a dealer by selling approximately one million shares of its common stock to the public and buying stock from other investors to make delivery to the new investors., Finally, the Court found Veitia liable for CRGs violations as a controlling person of CRG pursuant to Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act., The final judgment permanently enjoins the Veitia Defendants from violating Sections 17(a) and 17(b) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The judgment also enjoins Veitia, CRG and Stratcomm from violating Section 5 of the Securities Act, and CRG and Stratcomm from violating Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act by acting as an unregistered broker or dealer.  Finally, the judgment enjoins Veitia, as a controlling person of CRG pursuant to Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, from violating Sections 5, 17(a) and 17(b) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.  , The Commission Complaint, which was filed in 1999, named as defendants 13 other individuals and entities in addition to the Veitia defendants.  Each of the other defendants entered into settlements with the Commission in which they were enjoined and, where ordered, paid disgorgement and penalties, without either admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint.  , Previously, on July 19, 2002, the Court entered a final judgment by consent against Jose Antonio Gomez Cortes (Gomez), Fondo and Oportunidad.  Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Gomez, Fondo and Oportunidad each consented to the entry of a judgment which permanently enjoined them from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.  The judgment also required Gomez to pay a civil money penalty in the amount of $75,000, which he has paid., The Commission alleged in its Complaint that Gomez, Fondo and Oportunidad violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder by actively participating in CRGs fraudulent scheme.  Fondo and Oportunidad bought the securities of at least eight of CRGs issuer-clients in more than two dozen separate purchase agreements, the majority of which purportedly were undertaken pursuant to Regulation S, and then sold those securities in hundreds of transactions back into the United States, with much of the stock going to CRG to cover short positions it had taken.  According to the Complaint, Gomez signed many of the purchase agreements, along with stock transfer documents, account opening documents, checks, wires and correspondence in connection with those transactions., The Commission also alleged that, by virtue of the conduct described above, Gomez, Fondo and Oportunidad violated Section 5 of the Securities Act by selling securities of CRGs issuer-clients while no registration statement was in effect and without a valid exemption or safe harbor. , See also <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr16294.htm>Litigation Release No. 16294</a> (September 27, 1999)(filing of action); <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr16415.htm>Litigation Release No. 16415</a> (January 21, 2000)(final judgments entered against defendants Ammonia Hold, Inc. and Michael D.

The complaint further alleges that on each occasion, within days after learning that MedImmune was involved in confidential negotiations concerning a possible business combination with another public company - the first being U.S. BioScience, Inc., the second ImClone Systems, Inc., and the third Aviron - Tsao bought stock in the other company (and, in the case of ImClone, MedImmune stock as well).

(Lorus) and Capital Management Fund, Limited Partnership (Capital) (collectively, the defendants) should not be held in civil contempt was filed by the Commission on May 19, 2003, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, based on the defendants failure to provide an accounting, as required by an order issued by the Court on October 11, 2002.  , The Commissions complaint, filed on September 3, 2002, alleged that Eskind is a recidivist violator who was preliminarily enjoined in June 1997 and permanently enjoined on January 12, 1998 from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. Eskind was subsequently barred by the Commission from association with any investment adviser. That case was based upon allegations of fraudulent conduct by Eskind which included misappropriating investors funds, failing to disclose that Eskind had been suspended by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 1991, and inducing at least five investors to invest at least $500,000 in what was falsely represented to the investors to be a specified limited partnership. In fact, Eskind had been previously terminated from that partnership. The complaint further alleged that subsequent to being enjoined, and continuing until the filing of the complaint, Eskind raised at least $3 million through sales of limited partnership units in Capital.  Capital purportedly does business by trading in securities through initial or secondary public offerings. The sales materials misrepresented to investors Eskinds broker-dealer experience, and did not disclose his 1991 NYSE suspension, the Commissions 1997 civil action or the Commissions 2000 order barring him from association with an investment adviser. The complaint alleged that investors were told that IRA accounts had been opened for them at a trust company which serves as an IRA custodian and had received statements from Lorus indicating their funds in those accounts. In fact, no such accounts have been opened. The sales materials falsely stated that a major law firm provided legal representation for Lorus.

Conducting business individually and later through Worldwide Financial, Yetts fraudulently induced customers to entrust him with funds by falsely representing that he would invest their money in the stock market and other securities.  Instead of investing those funds, Yetts misappropriated or diverted the money for other purposes, including paying personal and business expenses, making payments to earlier investors, and buying and selling securities for his own account or for other accounts he controlled, including accounts maintained in the name of his sports agency business, World Wide Sports.  In an attempt to conceal his misconduct, Yetts provided customers with materially false and misleading periodic account statements which indicated that Worldwide Financial had bought and sold specific securities for their account.  When various customers demanded the return of their funds, Yetts falsely claimed that he had transferred their funds (unbeknownst to them) to a supposed money management firm in California, and that he was unable to retrieve their money.  Through his fraudulent conduct, Yetts exploited inexperienced and financially unsophisticated customers who relied on Yettss purported superior knowledge and expertise. , The district courts order provides the Commission with:  (1) injunctive relief as to Yetts and Worldwide Financial; (2) monetary judgments against Yetts, Worldwide Financial and World Wide Sports, to be paid jointly and severally, in the total amount of $2,980,627 (including disgorgement and prejudgment interest); and (3) a civil penalty of $110,000 against Yetts.

During this time period, Brooks never disclosed MJKs true financial condition which resulted from his departments failure to collect the marks owed to MJK to any of the broker-dealers his department conducted business with, while knowing the broker-dealers relied on MJKs financial condition to decide how much business to transact with MJK.  , The Commission further alleges that Brooks aided and abetted MJKs violations of the customer reserve requirements and record-keeping provisions during this same time period.  According to the Complaint, Brooks falsified two stock loan reports which were used by MJKs accounting department to incorrectly compute MJKs customer reserve deposit.  The false information was subsequently incorporated into MJKs FOCUS reports which Brooks subsequently provided to broker-dealers doing business with the SL Department., The Commission has charged Brooks with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and for aiding and abetting MJKs violations of Sections 15(c)(3) and 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 15c3-3, 17a-3 and 17a-5.

At the time, according to the Complaint, ImClone and the market were awaiting an imminent decision from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on one of ImClones key products, a cancer treatment called Erbitux.  The Commission alleges that information about the Waksals efforts to sell signaled insider pessimism about the FDA decision, the prospects for Erbitux, and the future of ImClone.  The Commission alleges that, based on this conduct, Stewart and Bacanovic violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., Specifically, the Commissions complaint alleges as follows:, In its lawsuit, the Commission seeks an order requiring that Stewart and Bacanovic, jointly and severally, disgorge $45,673, representing the losses avoided by Stewarts sale of ImClone securities, and that they pay civil penalties and prejudgment interest.  The Commission also seeks an order permanently enjoining Stewart and Bacanovic from violating the securities laws, and barring Stewart from acting as a director of, and limiting her activities as an officer of, a public company., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the investigation of this matter.,  , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18169.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  ]"

Charles W. McCall,</i> United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Civil Action No.  CO3-2603-SC</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against the former Chief Executive Officer of HBO &amp; Company and the former Chairman of the Board of Directors of McKesson HBOC, Charles W. McCall, for his role in the financial reporting fraud at the companies.  McKesson HBOC (since renamed McKesson Corporation), a Fortune 100 company with headquarters in San Francisco, California, was formed by the January 1999 merger of McKesson Corporation with HBO &amp; Company (HBOC), an Atlanta, Georgia-based vendor of healthcare software.  McCall becomes the eleventh person charged by the Commission in its investigation of the long-running fraudulent scheme to inflate the companys revenue and net income.  He is the highest company official to be charged.  McCall, age 59, lives in Fort Lauderdale, Florida., In a separate action, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Northern District of California also filed criminal charges against McCall and Jay Lapine, HBOCs former general counsel.  The Commission already has a securities fraud suit pending against Lapine.  , According to the Commissions complaint, McCall and other top officers participated in a long-running fraudulent scheme to artificially inflate revenue and net income of HBOC and later McKesson HBOC.  When the fraud was discovered in April 1999, McKesson HBOCs stock tumbled from approximately $65 to $34 a share, a drop that slashed the companys market value by more than $9 billion.  McCalls participation in the fraud began at least by January 1998 and continued through the March 1999 quarter, which was the first combined reporting period for McKesson HBOC.  , As alleged in the Commissions complaint, McCall, in concert with others, used a variety of means to inflate HBOCs and McKesson HBOCs revenues and earnings, most prominently, by the use of side letters and agreements in connection with software licensing contracts.  These side letters and agreements provided customers with the right to cancel contracts or return product if certain contingencies were not met.  Generally Accepted Accounting Principles preclude recognition of revenue from contingent contracts, until the contingency is satisfied.  The side letters were separated from the rest of the contracts and were not provided to the companys outside auditors  thus circumventing the companies accounting controls and falsifying the companies books and records., The Commissions charges allege that McCall, acting with others, engaged in other prohibited practices, such as backdating contracts and swapping inventory for the purpose of increasing revenue.  McCall, in concert with others, also is alleged to have managed earnings by using the companys acquisition reserves to reduce unrelated current expenses.  This violated Generally Accepted Accounting Principles because it artificially reduced reported operating expenses and increased quarterly net income and earnings per share., McCalls role in the fraud is alleged to have culminated in April 1999, when he was chairman of the board of directors of the combined McKesson HBOC.  Shortly after the end of McKesson HBOCs March 31, 1999 quarter, McCall helped negotiate a $20 million software deal with Data General Corporation.  The deal was then backdated to make it appear that it had been entered into prior to the end of the March 31, 1999 quarter, and McKesson HBOC fraudulently recognized revenue on the transaction in that quarter.  As alleged in the Commissions complaint, the Data General transaction was designed by McCall and others to enable McKesson HBOC to meet analyst expectations for the March 31, 1999 quarter, which also was McKesson HBOCs fiscal year end., The fraud alleged against McCall enabled HBOC to report an unbroken run of financial success, and continually to exceed analysts quarterly earnings expectations.  As a result of the fraud, the financial statements of HBOC, and later McKesson HBOC, were materially false and misleading during at least the period January 1998 through April 1999.  McKesson HBOC was required to restate its combined financial results for the previous three fiscal years.  , The Commission has charged that McCall violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder.  The Commission is seeking from McCall a permanent injunction against future violations of these provisions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The Commission also seeks to bar McCall from being an officer or director of a public company.  , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18170.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18170.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The complaint alleges that Bayne and Posnansky acted as unlicensed broker-dealers and engaged in the unregistered offer and sale of the stock of two companies, raising more than $4.6 million.  The complaint also alleges that Bayne made fraudulent statements in connection with the offer and sale of stock of one of the companies., The Commission charges that Bayne and Posnansky, acting through Pre-IPO Financial Group, LLC, a now-defunct company that they jointly own, sold the stock of Intellect Exchange and Medical Online to almost 150 investors throughout the United States.  The complaint alleges that, from February 2000 through July 2001, Bayne and Posnansky sold more than $4.6 million of stock in the two companies and made more than $2.4 million in profits.  According to the complaint, Bayne misrepresented to potential investors the likelihood that Intellect Exchange would be acquired or would conduct an initial public offering, and greatly exaggerated the returns that an investor would obtain if an acquisition or public offering were to occur.  The complaint alleges that Bayne was responsible for the following misrepresentations: that Oracle Corp. had offered to purchase Intellect Exchange, that Intellect Exchange had been offered a reverse initial public offering worth $30 to $100 million, and that Intellect Exchange stock would open at $10 per share after its initial public offering.  The complaint further alleges that neither of the offerings was registered with the Commission, and that neither Bayne nor Posnansky was registered with the Commission as a broker-dealer, as required., The Commission alleges that, as a result of the conduct described above, Bayne and Posnansky each violated the securities and broker-dealer registration provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint, defendants, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, consented to the entry of final judgments., According to the SECs complaint, Sprawlnet operated a diversified communications services company that concentrated in the pay telephone, prepaid phone card and Internet search engine/portal businesses and raised approximately $7 million through in-house sales representatives offering and selling Sprawlnets stock.

Fishbach, Daniel S. Marchibroda and Gregory B. Tayler</i>, Civil Action No. 03 CV 4087 (DLC) (S.D.N.Y.) (June 5, 2003)</h2>]","[On June 5, 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil fraud injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York charging six former senior executives of Xerox Corporation, including its former chief executive officers, Paul A. Allaire and G. Richard Thoman, and its former chief financial officer, Barry D. Romeril, with securities fraud and aiding and abetting Xeroxs violations of the reporting, books and records and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws.  The complaint alleges that the executives engaged in a fraudulent scheme that lasted from 1997 to 2000 that misled investors about Xeroxs earnings to polish its reputation on Wall Street and to boost the companys stock price.  The scheme involved the use of accounting devices that were not disclosed to investors, many of which violated generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  The complaint alleges that the defendants fraudulent conduct was responsible for accelerating the recognition of equipment revenues by approximately $3 billion and increasing pre-tax earnings by approximately $1.4 billion in Xeroxs 1997-2000 financial results.  The six defendants have agreed to pay over $22 million in penalties, disgorgement and interest without admitting or denying the SECs allegations., The complaint names the following individuals as defendants who held senior positions at Xerox during 1997 through the publication of Xeroxs 2000 financial statements:, The Commissions complaint alleges that the defendants relied on what Xerox internally called one-time actions, one-offs, accounting opportunities and non-operational actions to impose accounting adjustments on operational results for the purpose of increasing equipment revenues and inflating earnings in financial results Xerox reported to the public.  These accounting actions, which were not disclosed to investors, were used at the end of each financial reporting period during 1997  2000 to close the gap between Xeroxs actual underlying earnings and its internal targets and those of Wall Street analysts.  The accounting devices improved Xeroxs earnings, equipment revenues and margins in each quarter and year during 1997  2000, and allowed Xerox to meet or exceed Wall Street expectations in nearly every reporting period during 1997  1999.  By 1998, nearly three out of every ten dollars of Xeroxs annual reported pre-tax earnings and up to 37 percent of its reported quarterly pre-tax earnings came from undisclosed changes to its historic accounting practices and estimates., According to the complaint, CEOs Allaire and Thoman, and CFO Romeril, set a tone at the top of the company, which equated business success with meeting short-term earnings targets.  Romeril directed or allowed lower ranking defendants in Xeroxs financial department to make accounting adjustments to results reported from operating divisions to accelerate revenues and increase earnings.  Fishbach, Marchibroda and Tayler adopted and applied the accounting devices for the purpose of meeting earnings goals and predictions of outside securities analysts.  Allaire and Thoman then announced these results to the public through meetings with analysts and in communications to shareholders, celebrating that Xerox was enjoying substantially greater earnings growth than true operating results warranted.  , The complaint alleges that the defendants used undisclosed accounting devices to close the gap between underlying and desired financial results, and that the defendants were aware of Xeroxs increasing dependence on such accounting actions during 1997-2000 through various internal Xerox reports, memos, e-mails and meetings that addressed the financial performance of Xeroxs significant operating units and the companys overall consolidated financial results.  For example, the complaint alleges:, Specifically, the Commissions complaint alleges that all of the defendants fraudulently failed to disclose to shareholders and investors the financial impact of the two principal accounting devices Xerox used during 1997-2000.  These devices, which were known internally within Xerox as return on equity and margin normalization, accelerated the recognition of equipment revenue and increased earnings from leases of Xerox copiers that historically were recorded in future periods.  These two accounting actions increased Xeroxs equipment revenues by $2.8 billion and its pre-tax earnings by $699 million from 1997 to 2000.  The complaint alleges that under Xeroxs leasing arrangements, the revenue stream from Xeroxs customer leases typically had three components:  the value of the box, a term Xerox used to refer to the equipment; revenue that Xerox received for servicing the equipment over the life of the lease; and financing revenue that Xerox received on loans to its lessees.  Under GAAP, Xerox was required to book revenue from the box at the beginning of the lease, but was required to book revenue from servicing and financing over the course of the entire lease.  The complaint alleges that the return on equity method shifted revenue to equipment that the company historically had allocated to financing, and that margin normalization shifted revenue to equipment that historically had been allocated to servicing.  The complaint alleges defendants Romeril, Fishbach, Marchibroda and Tayler, Xeroxs senior financial executives, knew or were reckless in not knowing that these accounting devices violated GAAP and should have been disclosed under GAAP.  , In addition to these accounting devices, the complaint alleges that Romeril, Fishbach and Marchibroda participated in the use of other non-GAAP accounting devices that allowed Xerox to prematurely recognize revenues from price increases it negotiated with existing customers and to retroactively increase the estimated residual values of its equipment (the estimated value of the equipment at the end of the lease term).  The complaint alleges that Tayler, as director of accounting policy, was also aware of these accounting practices.  , The complaint further alleges that Romeril, Fishbach and Marchibroda knowingly or recklessly used $415 million of excess or cushion reserves and $157 million of income from tax refunds to improperly increase earnings in violation of GAAP, and that Tayler was aware of the improper use of the largest of these reserves.  , Finally, the complaint alleges that all of the defendants failed to disclose the impact that approximately $400 million in sales of leases had on Xeroxs 1999 operating results.  The effect of these undisclosed sales was to immediately recognize income that otherwise would have been recognized in future periods.  Although Xerox earlier had entered into similar transactions in small amounts, none compared in size or scope to the 1999 sales, which added $182 million in pre-tax profits to Xeroxs 1999 results.  The complaint alleges that all of the defendants knew or should have known that these undisclosed transactions concealed financial and operation weaknesses., The defendants have each offered to settle by consenting, without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, to the entry of a final judgment in the civil action that:  , In addition, both Romeril and Tayler have agreed to the entry by the SEC of an Order pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the SECs Rules of Practice that suspends each of them (based on the entry of the injunction in the federal court action) from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an accountant.  This Order will suspend Romeril permanently and suspend Tayler for three years with a right to apply for reinstatement after the three-year period., The Commission previously brought two other injunctive actions based on the same fraudulent scheme as is alleged against the senior Xerox executives, as well as other allegations.  On April 11, 2002, the Commission brought an injunctive action against Xerox.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Xerox consented to the entry of a Final Judgment that permanently enjoined the company from violating the antifraud, reporting and record keeping provisions of the federal securities laws.  Xerox also paid a $10 million civil penalty, agreed to restate its financial statements and agreed to hire a consultant to review the companys internal accounting controls and policies. <i>Securities and Exchange Commission v.

The Complaint alleges that Cooper tipped his broker, Chad Conner, who in turn, tipped Gordon Allen.  Allen tipped his business partner, Geibel, who purchased securities in advance of fourteen transactions and realized profits of $632,422. Geibel provided tips to a friend who traded and realized profits of $140,898.

The defendants are Mary Patten of Naples, Florida, Valenvalls Investment Corporation (Valenvalls), a New Zealand corporation with its principal place of business in Naples, Florida, Scott Hamilton of Sheridan, Oregon, and Harold Miller of Alta Loma, California., The Commissions complaint alleges that the defendants acted as the primary brokers of the VV-PP, a purported high-yield trading program, through which they defrauded investors of at least $6 million.  The complaint further alleges that through oral representations and written offering materials distributed to investors through a network of brokers, Hamilton and Miller falsely represented that: (1) investors funds would be used to trade Medium Term Notes (MTNs) on a secret market; (2) MTN trading would yield returns averaging 100 percent per week; (3) investors funds would be pooled at Valenvalls, an allegedly insured financial institution that would pay an additional 20 percent return (over and above the guaranteed 100 percent per week); and (4) the VV-PP was fed controlled and subject to International Monetary Fund rules and regulations.  According to the complaint, after having investors referred from Hamilton and Miller, Patten sent the investors promotional materials about Valenvalls, which falsely represented that:  (1) investors would receive individual accounts at Valenvalls, promoted as an `international financeria that could trade bonds, currency, real estate, and securities and (2) Valenvalls would pay investors a 20 percent return on their investment (over and above the guaranteed 100 percent per week).  The Complaint also alleges that Patten sent investors account statements falsely indicating that their funds were earning 20 percent in individual Valenvalls accounts.  Ultimately, the complaint alleges, the defendants lulled investors with misrepresentations that the VV-PP was proceeding as planned, when in fact Patten had diverted investors funds to her personal use., Based on the facts alleged, the Commissions complaint charges the defendants with securities fraud in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rule 10(b)(5), offering and selling unregistered securities in violation of Securities Act Sections 5(a) and 5(c), and acting as unregistered brokers or dealers in violation of Exchange Act Section 15(a).

As part of the settlement, the defendants will pay over $1.3 million in disgorgement and penalties, which will be used to repay investors., The SECs case was originally filed on June 9, 2000 in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.  According to the SECs complaint, the website described the StockGeneration program as a virtual stock exchange in which participants could buy and sell virtual shares in several virtual companies at prices set by SG.  The website stated that the share price of one company, identified as Company #9 or the Privileged Company, would generate a risk-free, guaranteed return of 10% per month, or 215% per year.  The complaint alleged that in April 2000, SG unilaterally reduced the virtual share prices by nearly 100% and stopped honoring investors requests to redeem their virtual shares and recover their money.  The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit ruled in September 2001 that an investment in Company #9 was an investment contract, a form of security covered by the federal securities laws.  Approximately 45,000 investors worldwide placed money in Company #9 and lost a total of $850,558., On May 29, 2003, the Honorable George A. OToole, United States District Judge for the District of Massachusetts, entered a final judgment by consent.

Powell, former President of Irvine Securities, Inc. and currently a movie producer who co-owns Filmstar Productions, Inc., on a criminal complaint charging him with making false statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The complaint, filed on May 29, 2003, by the United States Attorneys Office for the Central District of California, charges Powell with making false statements to a federal agency, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001.  An affidavit filed in support of the complaint alleges that during late 2001 and 2002, Powells attorney discussed with the Commission possible resolution of a civil case filed by the Commission against Mr. Powell and others.  During the course of settlement discussions, Powell sought waiver of the amount of disgorgement and submitted two sworn financial statements, dated January 2002 and July 2002.  The affidavit alleges that in each of the financial statements, Powell claimed he had no equity in his Laguna Beach house because his mortgage was exactly equal to the propertys quick sale market value., The affidavit further alleges that when the Commission obtained Powells credit report in approximately August 2002, the Commission learned that Powell had refinanced his Laguna Beach home in February 2002.  Through that refinancing Powell borrowed $1,750,000, and received a check in the amount of $428,378.85.  Powell deposited the money into the account of Filmstar Productions, Inc., a company Powell co-owns and operates.  Since then, Powell has signed checks on the Filmstar account made payable to himself and others.  According to the affidavit, the financial statements submitted to the Commission did not disclose that Powell had refinanced his Laguna Beach house in February 2002 to withdraw more than $428,000 in cash from the property.  Nor did the financial statements disclose that Powell transferred this cash to Filmstar.  Nor did they identify the transfer of money to Filmstar as a loan from Powell. , On October 10, 2002, in an action brought by the Commission, the United States District Court for the Central District of California entered an injunction prohibiting Powell from violating the securities registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5., For additional information, see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr15822.txt>Litigation Release No. 15822</a>.  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18182.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Lynn Bentley is the wife of defendant Robert Bentley.  The dismissal was the result of a comprehensive settlement involving the resolution of the Commissions claims against Mrs. Bentley as well as litigation between her and the receiver appointed by the court.  The Commission filed an amended complaint naming Mrs. Bentley as a relief defendant in January 2002.  In that amended complaint the Commission sought the return of funds received by Mrs. Bentley that it alleged were proceeds of fraudulent conduct by the named defendants., On November 7, 2001, United States District Court issued a preliminary injunction and order continuing the appointment of a receiver and asset freeze against Robert L. Bentley, Bentley Financial Services, Inc. and Entrust Group.  The preliminary injunction prohibits violations of the antifraud and broker-dealer registrations provisions set forth in Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The order continues a freeze of the defendants assets and the appointment of David H. Marion of the Philadelphia law firm Montgomery, McCracken, Walker &amp; Rhoads LLP as a receiver to take control of their assets.  The defendants consented to the entry of the preliminary injunction and order without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations in the action.  A trial date in the action has not been set., The Commissions complaint alleged that the defendants claimed to be selling bank-issued, federally insured certificates of deposit (CDs), but that the defendants were in fact selling uninsured securities.  Although the defendants were using at least some investor funds to buy CDs, the terms of the CDs often varied substantially from those of the securities defendants were selling.  The Commission also alleged that, in many cases, investors had to rely on the defendants ability to attract new investors in order for previous investors to receive repayment of their principal.  Accordingly, investors were not buying the low-risk, federally-insured CDs that they were promised.  Rather, they were buying higher risk securities issued by defendants, whose business was uninsured, unaudited and unregulated.  When the Commission filed the action, hundreds of financial institutions and individual investors located nationwide had over $300 million invested with the defendants., For further information see Litigation Releases: <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17228.htm>17228</a> (November 13, 2001); <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17206.htm>17206</a> (October 25, 2001); <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17201.htm>17201</a> (October 23, 2001); and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17298.htm>17298</a> (January 9, 2002)., <!-- End text -->,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18183.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Yoder, age 25, of Sarasota, Florida, for operating two schemes that defrauded approximately 85 investors of over $1.6 million.  The Commissions complaint alleges from at least November 2000 through March 2001, Yoder raised approximately $1.6 million from investors by selling two different investments, one a prime bank trading program and another called All the Way to the Top.  In raising money, Yoder misrepresented the nature of the investments and the risk and rate of return.  In addition, he did not tell investors that he would use their funds  without their permission  for his own purposes.  During his solicitation of investors, Yoder resided in Goshen, Indiana.  Yoders scheme, All the Way to the Top, solicited investors over the Internet promising guaranteed risk-free monthly returns of 40% to 50%.  For this scheme, Yoder raised approximately $660,000 in investors funds.  Additionally, Yoder raised $1.02 million for a prime bank trading program.  This program promised risk-free guaranteed weekly returns of 100% per week for eleven months and supposedly involved the trading of medium term notes.  According to the Commissions complaint, Yoder could not produce the promised returns for these schemes, the prime bank trading program did not exist, investors never received any returns, and most investors lost their principal.  , The Commissions complaint alleges that Yoder engaged in violations of the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with these schemes.  The Commission seeks a permanent injunction barring Yoder from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The Court further ordered the parties to meet and confer within thirty days in an attempt to resolve the matter.  The Court issued this order in connection with an application filed by the Commission asking the Court to hold Aegis in contempt for violating the order to deposit the $210,000.  , The Commission had previously reached a settlement with Aegis, a Chicago-based commodities introducing broker.  The SEC did not charge Aegis with securities law violations, but instead named it as a relief defendant in order to require Aegis to return $210,000 of investors funds that had been loaned to it by defendant Michael Garian (Garian) and NIE.  , On February 11, 2003, the Court ordered Aegis to deposit $210,000 into the Courts registry no later than February 28, 2003.  On April 8, 2003, the Commission applied for a contempt order, alleging that Aegis violated the Courts order by depositing a $210,000 check that was subsequently returned by the bank marked Payment Stopped.  Aegis filed a response asserting that it was unable to comply with the Courts order because it lacked sufficient funds to do so.  , The Commissions complaint, filed on February 7, 2003 against NIE and Garian, alleges that between 1997 and mid-2001, Garian, 41, of Van Nuys, California, and Glendale-based NIE raised over $19 million from about 200 investors.  Most of the investors Garian and NIE targeted were residents of Glendales large Armenian-American community, many of whom had never invested in the stock market, and some of whom were Armenian immigrants for whom English was a second language.  Garian allegedly falsely told investors that he would use their money to purchase various securities for their accounts; had an inside line to upcoming hot IPOs, particularly for Internet and other technology-related companies; and could deliver large profits quickly.  The complaint charges that Garian and NIE furthered their scheme by sending investors false monthly account statements that represented that NIE was purchasing large volumes of IPO shares and other securities on their behalf and making large profits from Garians trading activities., The SECs complaint alleges that Garians and NIEs conduct violated federal antifraud, investment adviser fraud, and securities and investment company registration provisions of the federal securities laws.

Cal.)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on May 27, 2003, it filed a complaint in federal district court in Los Angeles against The Hartcourt Companies, Inc., based in Long Beach, California, Alan V. Phan, Hartcourts former Chairman, CEO and President and a resident of Long Beach, and Yongzhi Yang of Los Angeles.  The complaint alleges that the defendants participated in a scheme to illegally raise money for Hartcourt by using a Form S-8 registration statement.  , According to the complaint, from September 1999 to November 1999, Hartcourt raised over $800,000 by issuing one million shares of Hartcourt stock, pursuant to a Form S-8 registration statement, to Yangs wife, purportedly to compensate her for services provided to Hartcourt.  The complaint alleges that Phan, with Yangs assistance, used the majority of the Form S-8 stock to raise capital for Hartcourt.  Form S-8 registration statements permit the issuance of stock to consultants to compensate them for services rendered but cannot be used by the issuer, such as Hartcourt, to raise capital for itself.  The complaint also alleges that Phan caused Hartcourt to issue a series of false and misleading press releases while Yang was selling stock into the market.  During the period in which Hartcourt issued the press releases, its stock price rose from $1.27 to $4.50, a 254% increase., The Commissions complaint alleges that the defendants violated the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission is seeking permanent injunctions and civil penalties against Hartcourt, Phan, and Yang and disgorgement and prejudgment interest against Hartcourt and Yang.

Alpha was the subject of a settled cease-and-desist order issued by the Commission in September 2002; in the order, the Commission found that Dynegy violated the antifraud, reporting, books and records and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws, by reflecting Alphas impact on its financial statements in the form of $300 million in operating cash flow and $79 million in net income.  <i>In re Dynegy Inc.,</i> Exchange Act <a href=/litigation/admin/33-8134.htm>Release No. 34-46537</a> (September 24, 2002).<i> </i>The Commission found in its order that the Alpha-derived funds were actually loan proceeds, representing, therefore, cash flow from financing activities, not operations, and that the Alpha-derived tax benefit was invalid.  In settling the Commissions action, Dynegy also paid a $3 million civil penalty., In its action against the former Dynegy employees, the Commission alleges that they engaged in fraud, and that they aided and abetted Dynegys fraud, and other federal securities law violations, arising out of the Alpha transaction.  The individuals named in the Commissions suit are:, <p class=em2><b>Gene S. Foster</b>, age 44, of Houston, Texas.  Foster, a Texas-licensed CPA, was Dynegys Vice President of Taxation during the relevant period and was responsible for all of Dynegys tax-related matters, including planning and compliance issues;  , <p class=em2><b>Jamie Olis</b>, age 37, of Houston, Texas.  Olis was Dynegys Senior Director, Tax Planning and International for most of 2000 and 2001.  In January 2002, Olis was promoted to Vice President, Finance.

Sharkey was Dynegys Manager  Accounting, Deal Structure during the relevant period.  Sharkey, a Texas-licensed CPA, was the sole accounting representative assigned to the Alpha deal team.  , In its complaint against Foster, Olis and Sharkey, the Commission alleges, in part, as follows: that in early 2001, tax and accounting professionals employed by Arthur Andersen LLP, Dynegys auditor, worked closely with the defendants in structuring Alpha; that Andersen established guidelines for the structuring of Alpha to ensure the validity of Dynegys intended accounting for Alpha under generally accepted accounting principles; that in the spring of 2001, Foster, Olis and Sharkey, under pressure to complete Alpha, disregarded Andersens advice that certain forms of risk hedging would defeat Dynegys intended accounting for Alpha, by requiring Alpha to be recorded as a financing; that the defendants effectively excluded Andersens Alpha liaison, a tax professional, from crucial pre-closing meetings; that to ensure Alphas closing, the defendants linked certain hedges to each other, contrary to Andersens advice, in secret side agreements; and that the defendants allowed the equity investors in an Alpha special purpose entity to hedge all commodity price risk, also against Andersens specific advice.  According to the complaint, Foster, Olis and Sharkey, knowing that, due to the proscribed hedge transactions, Dynegy could not rely on Andersens support for its accounting for Alpha, intentionally concealed the transactions from Andersen and from Dynegy  and consequently, from the investing public., The Commission alleges in its complaint that Foster, Olis and Sharkey violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder and, that Foster, Olis and Sharkey aided and abetted Dynegys violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13, thereunder.

The Commissions complaint alleges that from the second quarter of fiscal 1998 through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, Davis engaged in a scheme to overstate Network Associates revenue and earnings, and thereby inflate the companys stock price., According to the complaint, Davis and other Network Associates employees actively participated in a multi-part scheme to artificially inflate the revenue generated from the sale of the companys products to distributors.  The scheme included:  , , , , , , The complaint further alleges that Davis took action to conceal the fraud.  For example, in many instances, the payments and discounts to distributors were recorded improperly in Network Associates books and records.

According to the Complaint, Norman and Baillargeon made false and misleading representations concerning Alliances cultivation and sale of fast-growing paulownia trees, its breeding and selling of live goats and carcasses, and its development of a nationwide chain of chiropractic franchise clinics, among other matters.  The Complaint alleged that Norman and Baillargeon disseminated false and misleading projections of Alliances future revenues and earnings knowing that Alliance was a foundering company that had no paulownia tree business, goat business or chiropractic business.  In addition, the Complaint alleged that Norman engaged in transactions designed to make it appear that there was an active market for Alliances common stock, and he personally sold more than 90,000 shares of his unregistered Alliance common stock directly to members of the public.  The Complaint alleged that as a result of the defendants fraudulent conduct, investors lost more than $1.4 million.  , Norman, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions Complaint, consented to the entry of a Final Judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the securities registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws - Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.

Spitzer for his role in an 11-quarter financial fraud at Peregrine Systems, Inc., a San Diego-based software company.  The Commissions complaint alleges that Spitzer, a former vice president of sales, participated in a scheme with other senior Peregrine executives and other parties to inflate Peregrines revenue and stock price.  The complaint also alleges that Spitzer engaged in illegal insider trading of Peregrine stock., According to the complaint, the heart of the fraud was the recording of millions of dollars of revenue in violation of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).  Spitzer negotiated some of the largest of Peregrines fraudulent transactions at the urging of more senior executives.  These transactions consisted of non-binding sales of software licenses to resellers (or purported resellers) with the understanding that the resellers owed nothing to Peregrine unless the software was sold to an end-user.  Those involved in the scheme called this parking the transaction.  Spitzer knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that parking transactions were intended to, and did, fraudulently inflate Peregrines revenue.  Spitzer generated millions of dollars of bogus revenue through these parking transactions, enabling Peregrine to meet quarterly revenue goals., The complaint further alleges that Spitzer, during the time he was aware of the ongoing fraud, illegally sold 185,000 shares of Peregrine common stock for proceeds of approximately $5.2 million on the basis of material, nonpublic information concerning Peregrines true financial condition., The Commissions complaint seeks to permanently enjoin Spitzer from violating certain antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws (Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5), and from violating, or aiding and abetting violations of, certain reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions (Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(5), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, and 13b2-1).

AFG was in the business of pooling investor money and then using those monies to make secured loans to individuals who pledged restricted stock as collateral.  On July 25, 2002, the Honorable Donald L. Graham, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Florida entered, among other things, an emergency order to temporarily freeze the assets of the defendants., In its amended complaint, the SEC restated, among other things, its allegations that: (1) AFG raised approximately $87 million from investors by selling them unregistered investment contracts consisting of fractionalized interests in restricted stock loans through AFGs so-called Restricted Stock Loan Program; (2) AFG enticed investors with promises of high returns with low risk because investments were purportedly over-collateralized with restricted stock; (3) Siegel, a recidivist securities laws violator, misappropriated investor monies and issued false statements to investors falsely showing high returns when, in fact, the investments were losing value because Siegel was misappropriating the money raised by AFG; (4) AFG misled investors by failing to disclose in its offering materials and website that Siegel had a long history of securities laws violations, including an injunction entered against him in 1987 for participating in a stock manipulation scheme; and (5) the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws., In adding Chism as a defendant, the amended complaint alleges that Chism and Siegel, as control persons of AFG, are liable for AFGs fraud.

(Symbol), with engaging in a vast fraudulent scheme to manipulate Symbols reported financial results.  Based in Holtsville, New York, Symbol is a leading manufacturer of bar code scanners and related information technology whose stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange.  The complaint alleges that Korkuc and others rigged the financial results that Symbol reported in press releases and periodic reports filed with the Commission by manipulating millions of dollars in revenue, net income and other measures of financial performance from 1998 through 2002.  <b>Korkuc</b>,<b> </b>age 40, was Director of Corporate Accounting at Symbol before becoming Chief Accounting Officer in July 2000.  Symbol announced his resignation in March 2003., The Commissions complaint alleges that:, Among other fraudulent accounting practices, Korkuc and others manipulated reserves and made other improper adjustments to Symbols raw financial data to conform the reported results to market expectations.  Korkuc made or oversaw dozens of fraudulent entries on Symbols accounting records that boosted net income and otherwise enhanced the results by tens of millions of dollars.  Throughout the relevant period, Korkuc and others prepared schedules, known within Symbol as Tango sheets, that compared each quarters raw consolidated results to managements forecasts.  The Tango sheets described adjustments to reserves and other items that eliminated shortfalls and otherwise rigged the reported results.  Korkuc distributed the Tango sheets to members of senior management and then adjusted the raw results according to their instructions.  These adjustments grossly violated generally accepted accounting principles., When making these improper topside adjustments, Korkuc knew that the raw results were already inflated because of fraudulent revenue recognition practices and similar misconduct.  Korkuc played a role in some of these other fraudulent practices, including paying resellers to secure their assistance in Symbols channel stuffing schemes and recognizing sales revenue before the product was even shipped.  Korkuc also played a role in efforts to perpetuate and conceal the fraud.  He was involved in obtaining phony bill and hold letters to disguise premature revenue recognition, reclassifying past due trade receivables into undisclosed notes receivable to hide the adverse effects of channel stuffing on cash collection, and making fictitious general ledger entries to obscure earlier Tango sheet adjustments.  After the Commission began its investigation, Korkuc and others took additional steps to conceal important elements of the fraud from Symbols outside counsel and the government. , As a result of these and other fraudulent practices, Symbol materially overstated its revenue and net income in press releases and periodic reports filed with the Commission and disseminated to the public from 1998 through 2002.  Symbol is in the process of restating these financial results.  According to Symbols public disclosures, the restatement will include changes in reserves and reductions in revenue and net income during the period that Korkuc was involved in the fraud., Symbols disclosures about the need for a restatement arise from an internal investigation into the companys financial reporting practices that began in the spring of 2002 at the request of the Commissions staff., In the complaint, the Commission seeks a permanent injunction enjoining <b>Korkuc</b> from:  (i) committing securities fraud in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5; (ii) falsifying corporate books and records, circumventing internal controls, making false and misleading statements to accountants, and engaging in other conduct in violation of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2; and (iii) aiding and abetting Symbols violations of corporate reporting, recordkeeping and internal control provisions of the Exchange Act (Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13).

Judge Feikens also ordered Ajemian to pay $256 million in restitution.  Previously, on August 28, 2001, Ajemian pled guilty to one count of mail fraud and one count of making false statements to the Commission., Ajemian and six other MCA executives and employees (defendants) are the subjects of a pending civil injunctive action filed by the Commission on April 23, 2002 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan involving alleged violations of the antifraud, reporting and other provisions of the federal securities laws.  The Complaint alleges that MCA was a mortgage banking company headquartered in Southfield and Troy, Michigan that engaged in a financial and offering fraud in connection with two different types of securities.  First, the Complaint alleges that MCA sold $71 million of securitized interests in pools of mortgage loans from 1994 through 1999 while knowingly misrepresenting the risk, rate of return and historical performance of the interests in the offering materials.  The Complaint alleges that, as a result, investors lost at least $49 million.  Second, the Complaint alleges that MCA engaged in the fraudulent sale of $19 million in debentures between 1994 and 1999 by including financial statements that materially inflated its assets, income and equity in registration statements and annual and quarterly reports filed with the Commission.  The Complaint further alleges that MCA materially inflated its assets, income and equity by improperly: (1) recognizing gains on sale of real estate to related parties; (2) valuing certain mortgages held for resale; (3) failing to disclose related party mortgages held for resale; (4) failing to write down uncollectible related party receivables; and (5) failing to disclose MCAs potential liability in connection with the fraudulent sale of the securitized interests in pools of mortgage loans.  The Complaint alleges that as a result, investors in the debentures lost all $19 million invested.  , The Complaint alleges that all seven defendants violated, or aided and abetted violations of, the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws as a result of their involvement in MCAs fraudulent sale of securities.  In addition, the Complaint alleges that Ajemian and four other defendants violated, or aided and abetted violations of, the periodic reporting and corporate record-keeping provisions of the federal securities laws.  The Complaint seeks, among other things, injunctive relief and civil penalties against all seven defendants and seeks to bar Ajemian and three other defendants from acting as an officer and director of a public company in the future.  , Criminal proceedings also have been instituted with respect to the other six defendants in the Commissions Complaint.  Four of the defendants in the Commissions Complaint have pled guilty to federal charges arising out of MCAs fraudulent scheme.  Only one of those defendants, Keith Pietila, has been sentenced.  Pietila was sentenced to four years in prison and $256 million in restitution on May 8, 2003.  The remaining two defendants in the Commissions Complaint were indicted on federal charges of conspiracy, mail fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud and making false statements to the Commission on June 23, 2002 and are scheduled to be tried in January 2004.

The Commission alleged in its complaint that Clarke and others participated in a fraudulent offering scheme that raised at least $52 million from investors.  In the default judgment, the Honorable Mary M. Lisi permanently enjoined Clarke from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and ordered him to pay approximately $25 million in disgorgement, interest and a penalty., The Commission filed its action against Clarke and eight other defendants and a relief defendant on April 1, 2002, alleging that Clarke, operating through entities formerly known as Brite Business S.A. and Brite Business Corporation, initiated a scheme that made fraudulent representations to investors through a high yield trading program.  According to the Commissions complaint, Clarke raised approximately $51.75 million from five investors.  The Commissions complaint alleges that agreements Clarke entered into with these investors promised astronomical returns (such as a nearly 300% return in twelve banking days) and possessed characterizations of investment programs typical of prime bank investment schemes to defraud.  The complaint further alleges that, between 1999 and 2001, Clarke and others associated with Brite Business misappropriated, transferred or lost approximately $20 million in investor funds.  , On April 3, 2002, the court issued a temporary restraining order freezing the assets of Clarke and others.  The June 10, 2003 final judgment enjoins Clarke from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, orders him to pay disgorgement in the amount of $19,800,000, plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $4,863,372.72, for a total amount of $24,663,372.72, and assesses a $250,000 civil monetary penalty against him., For further information, please see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17800.htm>Litigation Release Numbers 17800</a> (October 23, 2002) [permanent injunction entered against Defendant Dennis Herula]; <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17957.htm>17957</a> (January 29, 3003) [permanent injunction entered against Defendant Mary Lee Capalbo]; <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17461.htm>17461</a> (April 5, 2002) [asset freeze against Clarke and others].,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18196.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Michael, Jr.) (filed November 19, 2001)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on Wednesday, June 6, 2003, the Honorable Judge James H. Michael, Senior U.S. District Court Judge for the Western District of Virginia, Charlottesville Division, entered an order setting disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalty amounts against Terry L. Dowdell, the mastermind of a massive international Ponzi scheme.  The Court also entered judgments against Dowdells wife and daughter, as relief defendants in this action, requiring them to disgorge all of the ill-gotten gains that Dowdell transferred to them, including their residences. In a related criminal matter, Dowdell previously pled guilty to criminal charges of securities fraud, wire fraud and money laundering stemming from this scheme, and is awaiting sentencing.  He is currently incarcerated in connection with his violation of the Courts asset freeze orders in this case., The judgment requires Dowdell to pay disgorgement of $121,235,000, plus $8,611,214.42 in prejudgment interest.  The court also imposed a $1,000,000 civil penalty.  The Court had previously entered a permanent injunction order against Dowdell prohibiting future violations of the federal securities laws and has appointed Roy M. Terry Jr. and the laws firm of DurretteBradshaw, PLC as Receiver to oversee the liquidation of all of Terry Dowdells assets.  Thus far, the Receiver has marshaled approximately $23 million of investor funds located in U.S. banks under Dowdells control, and has obtained an additional approximately $1.4 million in May 2003 through the auction of Dowdells residence and personal possessions in Charlottesville.  The disgorgement and civil penalty amounts entered against Dowdell are identical to the amounts the Court previously entered against Vavasseur Corporation. , The SECs enforcement action arises out of a fictitious investment program that Dowdell operated through Vavasseur Corporation, a Bahamian company controlled by Dowdell.  Dowdell, along with his marketers, represented to investors that the money would be wired to a bank account in the Bahamas invested in a trading program managed by Vavasseur that involved the purchase and sale of private foreign bank trading instruments, such as medium term debentures.  Dowdell and his associates represented to investors that the program would generate annual returns of as much as 160%, with little or no risk to principal., As Dowdell now admits, there were no trades or investments made by Vavasseur, but rather investors were paid their promised profits in a typical Ponzi scheme fashion from new investor funds diverted to Dowdells AmSouth accounts.  In the course of the fraud, Dowdell diverted millions of dollars of investor funds for himself, his associates and his family and friends., On June 4, 2002, exactly one year prior to the Courts order setting disgorgement and civil penalty amounts, Dowdell admitted to the fraud in the SECs action in a Consent and Stipulation, and the Court entered an order the same day permanently enjoining Dowdell from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The permanent injunction order provided for the future determination of disgorgement and civil penalty amounts, which are now incorporated in the June 4, 2003 order. , In his Consent and Stipulation, Dowdell admitted that foreign nationals, including Shinder Gangar and Alan White, citizens of the United Kingdom, have continued to raise investor funds in connection with the Vavasseur program even after November 19, 2001, and further admitted that various foreign banks have been used in furtherance of the fraud, including Overseas Development Bank &amp; Trust and Investors Bank &amp; Trust in Dominica, the Bank of Ireland in Ireland, Banamex Bank in Mexico, Butterfield Bank in the Commonwealth of Guernsey, Investec Bank in Israel, Fortis Bank in Belgium and Cathay Bank in Belize.   In its judgment order against Defendant Vavasseur Corporation, entered earlier this year, the Court ordered the repatriation of all Vavasseur funds held in overseas accounts.  The Receiver is working with foreign enforcement authorities to accomplish this.  , The Receiver has also filed a proposed plan of distribution to establish a claims process whereby injured investors may participation in the distribution of funds disgorged by Dowdell, Vavasseur and the other defendants in this lawsuit against whom judgments have or will be entered., The SEC and Department of Justice have been coordinating their enforcement efforts with law enforcement authorities in the United Kingdom and other countries, including the U.K. Serious Fraud Office (SFO), the Leicestershire Constabulary, the U.K. Financial Services Authority (FSA), the Antwerp Police, and Irelands Criminal Asset Bureau.  In related enforcement actions, the SFO and the Leicestershire Constabulary have arrested Gangar, White and others suspected of involvement of the Vavasseur Program and other fraudulent investment programs, and the FSA filed civil charges and obtained a worldwide asset freeze against White, Gangar and their accounting firms Dobb White &amp; Co and Morris White &amp; Co., accusing them of running an unlawful investment scheme.  , Additional information concerning the SECs lawsuit against Dowdell can be found in <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17242.htm>Litigation Release No. 17242</a>, November 19, 2001; <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17454.htm>Litigation Release No. 17454</a>, April 2, 2002; [<a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17553.htm>Litigation Release No. 17553</a>], June 10, 2002; [<a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17880.htm>Litigation Release No. 17880</a>], October 10, 2002; [<a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17881.htm>Litigation Release No. 17881</a>], October 10, 2002; and [<a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17905.htm>Litigation Release No. 17905</a>], December 19, 2002, [<a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17999.htm>Litigation Release No. 17999</a>], February 26, 2003, [<a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18029.htm>Litigation Release No. 18029</a>], March 11, 2003 and [<a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18143.htm>Litigation Release No. 18143</a>], May 19, 2003., Additional information on how prime bank and other banking-related investment schemes work can be found at the SECs Prime Bank Fraud Information Center (<a href=/divisions/enforce/primebank.shtml target=_top>http://www.sec.gov/divisions/enforce/primebank.shtml</a>) in the enforcement section of the SECs Web site, at the Receivers website, located at (<a href=/cgi-bin/goodbye.cgi?www.dowdell-receivership.com target=_top>http://www.dowdell-receivership.com</a>).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18198.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Cal.)</h2>]","[On June 19, 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed securities fraud charges against the former chief executive officer and former chief financial officer of Gemstar-TV Guide International, Inc. for their roles in a widespread and complex scheme to inflate Gemstars licensing and advertising revenues.  The Commissions lawsuit, filed in United States District Court in Los Angeles, seeks antifraud injunctions, civil money penalties, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains (including salaries, bonuses, and proceeds from the sale of stock during the fraud), and permanent bars from service as an officer or director of a public company.  The Commission also seeks continuation of the order that the district court entered on May 9, 2003 pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring Gemstar to place into escrow extraordinary payments to any of its directors, officers, or other affiliates, including nearly $38 million in cash payments that the company had previously agreed to pay the defendants., Named in the Commissions complaint are the following defendants:, Henry C. Yuen, age 55, of Pasadena, CA.  Yuen was Gemstars chief executive officer and chairman of the board during the relevant period., Elsie M. Leung, age 57, of Pasadena, CA.  Leung, a California-licensed CPA, was Gemstars chief financial officer and a member of its board of directors during the relevant period., The Commissions complaint alleges that Gemstar is a Los Angeles-based media and technology company that, among other things, publishes <i>TV Guide</i> magazine and develops, licenses, and markets an interactive program guide (IPG) for televisions.  The IPG is a technology that enables consumers to navigate through and select television programs.  During the relevant period, Gemstar generated revenues from the IPG by licensing the technology to third parties and selling advertising on the IPG.  In statements to securities analysts and the investing public, Yuen repeatedly touted the IPG technology and IPG advertising revenues as the companys future and as the value driver of the companys stock, and downplayed expected declines in revenue from <i>TV Guide</i> magazine., The complaint alleges that, to enable Gemstar to meet its ambitious projections for revenue growth from IPG licensing and advertising, Yuen, Leung, and others engaged in a fraudulent scheme to overstate Gemstars revenues and to report the inflated revenues to the investing public.  In total, the defendants caused Gemstar to overstate its total revenues by at least $223 million from March 2000 through September 2002. , The Commissions complaint alleges that Yuen and Leung manipulated Gemstars financial results in three ways.  First, Gemstar recorded revenue under expired, disputed, or non-existent agreements, and improperly reported this as IPG licensing and advertising revenue., Second, Gemstar recorded amounts from related transactions as if they were not related, some of which included round-trip transactions (that is, Gemstar paid money to a third party and then received it back) and non-monetary payments, and reported this as IPG advertising revenue in order to inflate those revenues., Third, Gemstar switched revenues from its media and licensing business sectors to its IPG advertising sector in order to show dramatic growth and acceptance of IPG advertising, when in fact such growth and acceptance did not exist.  In these transactions, Yuen and Leung allegedly created revenue by structuring the transactions so that all or a portion of the amount to be paid to Gemstar was nominally and falsely designated as the purchase of IPG advertising in order to inflate IPG advertising revenue.  , The Commissions complaint further alleges that Yuen and Leung reaped millions of dollars in financial gains from their fraudulent scheme in that their compensation was tied to the financial performance of the company.  By fraudulently overstating Gemstars revenues, Yuen and Leung fraudulently inflated their own salaries and bonuses.  According to the complaint, from 2000 through 2002, Yuen received approximately $18.8 million in salary and bonuses; exercised stock options for a taxable profit of approximately $14.6 million; and realized over $63.6 million from the disposition of Gemstar stock.  In addition, Yuen is seeking payment of over $29 million as a termination fee and payment of salary, bonuses, and vacation pay that he claims to be owed by Gemstar.  , During this same period, Leung received over $5.3 million in salary and bonuses, and exercised stock options for a taxable profit of approximately $4.9 million, according to the complaint.  In addition, she is seeking payment of over $8.1 million as a termination fee and payment of salary, bonuses, and vacation pay that she claims to be owed., The SECs complaint charges Yuen and Leung with securities fraud, lying to the auditors, falsifying Gemstars books and records, and aiding and abetting Gemstars reporting, record-keeping, and internal controls violations of the federal securities laws, specifically, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder., Previously, on May 9, 2003, the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles granted the SECs application for an order requiring Gemstar to escrow for 45 days any extraordinary payments to any of its directors, officers, partners, controlling persons, agents, or employees pursuant to Section 1103 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  The Courts order placed in escrow, subject to court supervision, approximately $37.64 million in cash payments that Gemstar had previously agreed to pay to Yuen and Leung.  , The Commissions investigation into the conduct of others is continuing., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18199.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18199.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

According to the Commissions complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, Webb engaged in fraudulent sales practices to increase Digital Lavas revenue by 54% during Q3 2000, which resulted in Digital Lava reporting false financial information in its Form 10-Q for that quarter.  On March 21, 2001, Digital Lava restated its Q3 2000 revenues from $1.7 million to $1.1 million.  Simultaneous with the filing of the complaint, Webb settled the action.  He consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the charged provisions., Digital Lava, previously headquartered in Marina Del Rey, California, provided digital publishing services and software products that created on-demand, interactive presentations, training, and communication services until its dissolution on January 30, 2002.  Its stock previously traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market. , The Commissions complaint alleges that during Q3 2000, Webb entered into several transactions with Digital Lavas dealers that involved placing contingencies, some documented in side letters, on the sale of a new product called Firestream.  Webb concealed the contingencies from Digital Lavas management and its auditors, which caused Digital Lava to improperly recognize revenue on these sales.  As a result, Digital Lava overstated revenue from its Firestream sales in Q3 2000 by $598,000, or 54%., The Commission charged Webb with violating or aiding and abetting violations of provisions of the federal securities laws, including the antifraud provisions (Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder), reporting provisions (Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder), record-keeping provisions (Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder), internal controls provision (Sections 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act) and lying-to-an-accountant provision (Rule 13b2-2 under the Exchange Act).  , In a related administrative proceeding announced today, the Commission also charged Robert C.

McNaughton, individually, and d/b/a The Haven Equity Company (McNaughton) and the unregistered offering of securities by Andrew K. Lech (Lech).  On June 24, 2003, Judge Dan A. Polster of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio entered temporary restraining orders restraining and enjoining McNaughton, a resident of Elyria, Ohio and Lech, a resident of Ontario, Canada from future violations of the federal securities laws.  The Court also ordered a freeze of certain assets of the defendants.  , The Commissions Complaint alleges that from at least 1999, McNaughton raised at least $20 million from approximately 150 investors through the sale of unregistered securities in the form of notes under the name of The Haven Equity Company (Haven Equity).  The Complaint also alleges that McNaughton and most of the investors reside in and around Lorain County, Ohio and belong to the same church where McNaughton is a youth assistant.  The Complaint alleges that in selling these notes, McNaughton fraudulently guaranteed a return on the investment as well as the principal. McNaughton guaranteed extraordinary annual returns of 15% to 20% to investors and told investors that they would receive their returns in the form of monthly interest payments.  The Complaint alleges that McNaughton told investors that he will send their money to his wealthy childhood friend, Lech, who is supposed to use his expertise in options trading to generate the guaranteed returns. Beginning in March 2003, investors did not receive their monthly interest payments.  The Complaint alleges that McNaughton lacked the financial resources to fulfill the guarantee.  McNaughton had no reasonable basis to believe that Lech would generate returns sufficient for McNaughton to make good on his guarantee because he had no details of what Lech did with investor money or of Lechs supposed securities trading.  Moreover, the Complaint alleges that McNaughton used funds from the Haven Equity bank accounts into which investor funds were deposited to pay certain personal expenses such as luxury automobiles, a boat, motor home and credit card purchases., The Complaint also alleges that as investors stopped receiving their payments, McNaughton resorted to raising additional investor funds which he used to continue paying other investors their monthly interest.  McNaughton also attempted to perpetuate the Haven Equity scheme, by convincing investors to transfer their investment to Lech, who offered his own notes (Lech notes) to Haven Equity investors, the terms of which were virtually identical to the Haven Equity notes.  However, investors who executed Lech notes never received their guaranteed returns.  , The Complaint further alleges that McNaughton violated Section 5 (a) and (c) and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Complaint also alleges that Lech violated Section 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The Commission seeks, among other things, an injunction against further violations of the federal securities laws, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest and appropriate civil penalties.

Md.)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the filing, on June 26, 2003, of securities fraud charges against Nathan A. Chapman, Jr., three of his companies and three of his associates in connection with the June 2000 initial public offering of  and subsequent secondary market trading in  the common stock of eChapman.com, Inc (now eChapman, Inc., or ECMN).  The Commissions complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil money penalties, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains (including salaries, bonuses and commissions) and bars from acting as an officer or director of a public company., The Commission alleges that the fraudulent scheme involved Chapman and officers of ECMN, a public company he controlled that is the parent company of a registered broker-dealer, The Chapman Company (TCC), and a registered investment adviser, Chapman Capital Management, Inc. (CCM).  Both of those companies are also controlled by Chapman. , Named as defendants in the Commissions complaint are:, The Commissions complaint alleges that, in an effort to rescue a failing IPO, Chapman, Bravo, Baldwin and Brown engaged in fraudulent conduct, including:  backdating trades and placing close to one-third of the IPO shares into the account of an advisory client; unauthorized sales of ECMN stock to TCC brokerage customers; manipulating the market for ECMN stock for months following the IPO; and filing false and misleading reports with the Commission.  As a result of the fraudulent conduct investors, including the Maryland state retirement and pension system, lost millions of dollars., The complaint alleges that in late 1999, Chapman decided to create a new public company that would take advantage of the growing influence of the Internet and provide a broad array of online financial services.  The new company, ECMN, was to be formed by merging two existing public companies, and the IPO was structured so that Chapman would own approximately 63 percent of ECMN.  However, in March 2000, the NASDAQ Composite reached its all-time high and began a steady decline.  Chapman had difficulty attracting investors and marketing an unproven dot-com company in the face of the falling stock market., The Commissions complaint further alleges that following the IPO on June 15, 2000, trading in ECMN opened significantly below its $13 per share offering price and never recovered.  Chapman, together with Bravo, used his control over TCC and CCM to have CCM improperly place 395,000 shares  almost one-third of the IPO  with CCMs advisory client, a trust, using the trusts sub-advisers, one of which was an investment adviser owned by Alan B. Bond, currently a convicted felon.  Of these shares, 175,000 were sold a week after ECMN began trading, when it was trading at $7.  Chapman and Bravo illegally backdated the sale to the IPO date, at $13 per share  resulting in an instant loss of over $1 million to the trust and its investors., The complaint further alleges that, in addition to the transactions at CCM, defendant Baldwin, with Bravos knowledge, made unauthorized trades and placed ECMN IPO shares in at least 37 customer accounts at TCC.  The customers on whom Baldwin preyed included the elderly, or individuals who had specifically requested low-risk investments.  Many knew nothing about investing or the stock market and relied on Baldwin to make their investment decisions., Finally, the complaint alleges that Chapman and Bravo, through TCC, manipulated the market for ECMN by using IPO proceeds to buy hundreds of thousands of ECMN shares in the months following the offering.  As a result, ECMN was left without funds to implement the business strategies that ECMN had represented to investors were the reasons for the IPO.  In further efforts to prop up the price of ECMN stock, Chapman, Bravo and others discouraged advisory clients and brokerage customers from selling their ECMN stock.  The defendants thereafter concealed their fraud with false and misleading statements regarding the use of the IPO proceeds in quarterly and annual reports filed with the Commission, prepared and signed by Chapman and Brown., The complaint charges all of the defendants with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; CCM, Chapman and Bravo with violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(3) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940; and ECMN, Chapman and Brown with violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1, 13a-13 and 12b-20 thereunder., The Commission brought this action in coordination with the United States Attorney for the District of Maryland, who filed related criminal charges against Chapman, and the Maryland Division of Securities, which filed civil charges against all of the defendants in the Commissions action., Contacts: Merri Jo Gillette, Associate District Administrator<br/>David S.

Peregrine Systems, Inc.</i>, Civil Action No. 03 CV 1276 K (LAB)  (S.D. Cal.) (June 30, 2003)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today sued San Diego-based software company Peregrine Systems, Inc., in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, for a massive financial fraud at the company that spanned 11 fiscal quarters.  Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint, the Commission submitted to the Court, for its approval, a partial settlement with Peregrine.  , According to the Commissions complaint, the purpose of the fraudulent scheme was to inflate the companys revenue and stock price.  To achieve that end, Peregrine filed materially incorrect financial statements with the Commission concerning the quarter ended June 30, 1999, through the quarter ended December 31, 2001.  In 2003 Peregrine restated its financial results for those quarters.  In its restatement, Peregrine reduced previously reported revenue of $1.34 billion by $509 million, of which at least $259 million was reversed because the underlying transactions lacked substance., The complaint alleges that Peregrine improperly booked millions of dollars of revenue for purported software license sales to resellers.  These transactions were non-binding sales of Peregrine software with the understanding-reflected in secret side agreements-that the resellers were not obligated to pay Peregrine.  Those involved in the scheme called this parking the transaction.  Peregrine personnel parked transactions when Peregrine was unable to complete direct sales it was negotiating (or hoping to negotiate) with end-users, but needed revenue to achieve its forecasts.  Peregrine engaged in other deceptive practices to inflate the companys revenue, including entering into reciprocal transactions in which Peregrine essentially paid for its customers purchases of Peregrine software.  Peregrine routinely kept its books open after fiscal quarters ended, and improperly recorded as revenue, for the prior quarter, software transactions that were not consummated until after quarter end.  Certain Peregrine officers characterized these transactions as having been completed on the 37th of December.   Peregrine senior officers, and sales and finance personnel knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that the applicable accounting rules prohibited revenue recognition on these and other transactions for which Peregrine booked revenue.  , The complaint alleges that, by various means, certain Peregrine officers and employees fraudulently concealed the revenue inflation scheme.  When Peregrine booked revenue for the non-binding reseller contracts, and the customers predictably did not pay, receivables-some of them bogus-ballooned on Peregrines balance sheet.  Large aged accounts receivable were not being paid, an indication that Peregrines financial health was deteriorating.  To make it appear to investors that Peregrine was collecting its receivables more quickly than it was, a senior officer entered into financing arrangements with banks to exchange receivables for cash.  Peregrine improperly accounted for these financing arrangements as sales of the receivables and removed them from the companys balance sheet.  There were several problems with this.  First, because Peregrine had given the banks recourse, and frequently paid or repurchased unpaid receivables from them, Peregrine should have accounted for the financing arrangements as loans and left the receivables on its balance sheet.  Second, some of the sold receivables were not valid because the customers were not obligated to pay Peregrine.  Third, several of the sold invoices were fake.  For example, in June 2001, Peregrines senior treasury manager, with senior managements approval and encouragement, created a false $19.59 million invoice and sold it to a bank.  As a result, Peregrines financial statements and books and records overstated Peregrines cash flow from operations, and understated its accounts receivable.  , The complaint also alleges that, as part of the cover up, Peregrine personnel wrote off millions of dollars in uncollectible-primarily sham-receivables, to acquisition-related accounts in Peregrines financial statements and books and records.  These write-offs were improper because they had nothing to do with acquisitions, and because the Peregrine personnel who directed the write-offs knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that certain written-off receivables should not have been recorded as revenue in the first place.  Peregrine misled investors by not including the write-offs in its pro forma operating results, and by making the write-offs appear on Peregrines income statement as one-time charges rather than expenses from operations.  Through its officers and employees, Peregrine knew that (a) a substantial portion of these receivables should not have been recorded as revenue in the first place, (b) the receivables were not impaired by acquisitions, and (c) it was inappropriate to make it appear to the investing public that the write-offs related to non-recurring events., The Commissions complaint seeks to permanently enjoin Peregrine from violating certain antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws (Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5), and from violating certain reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions (Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B), and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13).  The complaint also seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties., Peregrine, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint, has agreed (1) to be enjoined from violating the antifraud, reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws, (2) to disclose the current condition of its internal controls and financial reporting procedure, when a reorganization plan under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code becomes effective, (3) to comply, on an accelerated basis, with the rules regarding managements report on internal controls, implementing Section 303 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, (4) to retain an Internal Auditor to ensure that Peregrines financial results are accurately reported in Peregrines public financial statements, (5) to appoint a Corporate Compliance Officer to perform an ongoing review of Peregrines corporate governance policies and practices, and (6) to commence a training and education program for its officers and employees, to prevent violations of the federal securities laws.  The partial settlement provides that the amount of disgorgement and/or civil penalty to be paid by Peregrine, if any, shall be determined at a later date.  In determining to accept Peregrines offer of partial settlement, the Commission considered remedial acts promptly undertaken by Peregrine and cooperation afforded the Commission staff.  , This is the fourth civil fraud action the Commission has filed in this investigation.  In November 2002, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action against Ilse Cappel, the former senior treasury manager at Peregrine (Litigation Release No. 17859A).  In April 2003, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action against Matthew C.

Moreover, the complaint alleged that Langrill and Becker sold restricted Greater Northwest stock in unregistered transactions for profits of at least $24,537 and $46,400, respectively, while the false statements were disseminated through press releases, an Internet website, and a cable television infomercial.     According to the complaint, Langrill and Becker failed to file mandatory periodic and current reports with the Commission on behalf of Greater Northwest since 1996, and further failed to report their beneficial ownership and disposition of Greater Northwest stock., The Default Judgments permanently enjoin Langrill and Becker from violating Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(d), 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13d-1, 13d-2, 16a-2 and 16a-3 thereunder, and from controlling any person who violates Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder.

The Commissions complaint alleges that EK-1 and Adlman conducted a fraudulent unregistered securities offering between May 2000 and April 2002.  EK-1 raised approximately $700,000 from the sale of its stock to 64 investors nationwide.  , The two defendants are:, The complaint alleges that EK-1 and Adlman made four misrepresentations to investors.  First, they represented that EK-1 distributed a patented engine disruption device for use by law enforcement officers to stop high-speed vehicle pursuits.  In fact, it had only an unpatented prototype that was never distributed.  Second, they claimed that EK-1 would have an initial public offering (IPO) of its stock, but in fact it never was in a position to commence an IPO nor did it ever file a securities registration statement with the Commission.  Third, they promised that EK-1 would spend 50% of investor proceeds distributing the device but actually spent only 15% on expenses related to the device.  They spent approximately 79% on expenses relating to the securities offering, including payments to sales agents, purchases of lead lists, and the preparation, printing, and delivery of the offering materials.  Adlman retained about 6% of investor funds ($40,869) for himself.  Finally, they stated that EK-1s success depended on Adlman but failed to disclose his Commission bar order or a conviction in a market manipulation scheme.

The modifications to the proposed settlement filed today --- to which the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of WorldCom have consented --- provide that in the event of confirmation of a plan of reorganization of WorldCom by the Bankruptcy Court, WorldComs obligations under the Commissions judgment shall be deemed to be satisfied by the companys payment of $500,000,000 in cash and by its transfer of common stock in the reorganized company having a value of $250,000,000 to a distribution agent to be appointed by the District Court.

(Litigation Release No. 17588).  The Commission also sought the appointment of a corporate monitor for WorldCom, and on July 3, U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff appointed former SEC Chairman Richard Breeden to that position., On November 26, 2002, the Commission obtained a judgment against WorldCom through which the Commission obtained the full injunctive relief it sought against WorldCom.  In addition, the judgment ordered WorldCom to undertake extensive reviews of its corporate governance and internal controls, as well as required the WorldCom to establish a training and education program for WorldCom officers and employees to minimize the possibility of future violations of the federal securities laws.  The November 26, 2002 judgment explicitly left open the determination of monetary penalties to be imposed on WorldCom.

The Complaint alleged that Scoggin purposefully misled investors by: (i) misrepresenting that his stock picks were a product of independent research, rather that the product of his undisclosed financial and other contractual obligations to the companies he promoted;  (ii) failing to disclose that the issuers of the stocks he featured were paying for his recommendations; and (iii) engaging in scalping in two of the stocks featured in his newsletters and website, <i>i.e.</i>, he encouraged his readers to buy the featured stocks despite his undisclosed intent to sell his own positions in those stocks., The Final Judgment permanently enjoins Scoggin from further violating Section 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The Commission alleged in its complaint that Hertzog and others participated in a fraudulent offering scheme that raised at least $52 million from investors.  In the default judgment, the Honorable Mary M. Lisi permanently enjoined Hertzog from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and ordered him to pay approximately $25 million in disgorgement, interest and a penalty., The Commission filed its action against Hertzog and eight other defendants and a relief defendant on April 1, 2002, alleging that Hertzog played a key role in a scheme that made fraudulent representations to investors through a high yield trading program.  According to the Commissions complaint, the scheme, which raised approximately $52.75 million from six investors, was perpetrated by Hertzog and others through entities formerly known as Brite Business S.A. and Brite Business Corporation.  The Commissions complaint alleges that agreements Brite Business entered into with investors promised astronomical returns (such as a nearly 300% return in twelve banking days) and possessed characterizations of investment programs typical of prime bank investment schemes to defraud.  According to the Commissions complaint, during his contacts and correspondence with investors, Hertzog held himself out to be director, chairman and CEO of Brite Business.  The complaint further alleges that, between 1999 and 2001, Hertzog and others associated with Brite Business misappropriated, transferred or lost approximately $20 million in investor funds.  , On April 3, 2002, the court issued a temporary restraining order freezing the assets of Hertzog and others.

Herula, who is a defendant in two separate civil enforcement actions that the Commission has filed within the past 15 months, was arrested on a warrant in connection with a criminal indictment obtained by the U.S. Attorneys Office in Colorado.  The indictment, which was entered on January 30, 2003 and unsealed on April 11, 2003, charges that Herula participated in a fraudulent $40 million investment scheme.   On June 19, 2003 a federal magistrate ruled Herula a flight risk and ordered him held without bail pending the final resolution of the criminal case., The criminal indictment comes on the heels of two civil fraud actions the Commission filed against Herula and others.  The first action  filed on April 1, 2002 in federal court in Rhode Island  resulted in Herula being permanently enjoined from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws in October 2002 and ordered to pay approximately $19 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest and a civil monetary penalty.  As part of that action, in April 2002, the federal court in Rhode Island froze Herulas assets and preliminarily enjoined him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The Commission filed a second civil injunctive action against Herula and others on July 31, 2002 in federal court in San Francisco, alleging that Herula and others participated in another scheme to defraud investors out of $40 million.  In that case, the San Francisco federal court granted the Commissions request for emergency relief against Herula and others, and issued an order freezing over $36 million in funds they received from investors. That enforcement action is still pending in California., According to the indictment, approximately three months after the Commission obtained an asset freeze and preliminary injunction against Herula in the first civil injunctive action, Herula participated in the second fraudulent scheme that solicited $40 million from investors, by promising exorbitant returns on their investment.  The indictment alleges that as part of the second scheme, Herula failed to disclose to the investors that the Commission had obtained an asset freeze and preliminary injunction against him.  The indictment also alleges that millions of dollars of investor funds were transferred without authorization to accounts in Herulas control and to accounts in the control of Herulas wife, Mary Lee Capalbo, and co-defendant, Claude Lefebvre., Also, in January 2003, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Providence issued a separate warrant for Herulas arrest based on his failure to participate in a bankruptcy proceeding he commenced after entry of the $19 million judgment in Rhode Island.  On May 29, 2003, a U.S. magistrate in Providence ordered Herula held in custody for transfer to the District of Colorado to face charges there.  Prior to transferring Herula to Colorado to face criminal charges, federal agents escorted Herula to Rhode Island bankruptcy court, where he asserted his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination in response to all questions.  On June 19, 2003, Herula was arraigned in the District of Colorado and a U.S. magistrate, finding that Herula was a flight risk, ordered him detained pending the final resolution of the case., For further information, please see Litigation Release Numbers <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17600.htm>17600</a> (October 23, 2002), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17793.htm>17793</a> (October 18, 2002) and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17514.htm>17514</a> (May 13, 2002).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18213.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

In its Complaint filed on November 13, 2001, the Commission alleged that, beginning in 1999, Chabot, individually and through his entities, raised over $1.2 million from 14 investors by making material misrepresentations and omissions to them concerning an alleged hedge fund.  Chabot falsely claimed he was an experienced trader and that he had developed a mathematical model to predict when to buy stocks and whether to take long or short positions.  Chabot also prepared false and misleading account statements for the investors, claiming large returns on the purported investments made by the alleged hedge fund.  , As alleged in the Commissions Complaint, Chabot did not buy stocks or other securities with the investors funds.  Instead, he used their money for his personal expenses.  On January 8, 2002, Chabot pled guilty to one count of securities fraud and one count of wire fraud before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, in <i>United States v. Peter W. Chabot</i>, Case No. 02 Cr 19.

The final judgment also provided that any remaining assets and funds in Chabot Investment Inc.s bank accounts be applied in partial satisfaction of the February 27, 2002 order in the criminal action, which ordered Chabot to pay restitution to his victims.  In addition, on June 27, 2003, the court entered a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal against defendants, The Synergy Fund LLC, Sirens Investments, Inc., and Sirens Synergy.  The Commission moved to dismiss its claims against these defendants because, although referenced in documents prepared by Chabot, they were later determined not to exist.   , On July 3, 2003, based on the entry of the final judgment against Chabot, the Commission also instituted settled administrative proceedings against him pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

Benjamin Franklin Cook </i>[3-99CV05701-R, USDC, NDTX (Dallas Division)]].  The additional emergency relief permitted the Commission and the North Carolina Securities Division, on the same day, to conduct a joint action aimed at halting an alleged ongoing fraudulent scheme, securing evidence and assets for the reimbursement of defrauded investors, and obtaining the arrest of the alleged perpetrators, Robert Burr and Daniel Burr, two brothers residing in Wilmington, North Carolina.  Robert Burr, 40, was arrested and charged with six counts of felony securities fraud and two counts of felony obtaining property by false pretenses.  His brother, Daniel Burr, 53, was arrested and charged with two counts of obtaining property by false pretense. , Burr and a company he controlled, Cornerstone Management, L.L.P., are both already subject to judgments in excess of $4 million in the <i>Dennel</i> matter.  These judgments arise from Burrs participation in the Dennel Finance Limited fraud, a Ponzi scheme master-minded by Phoenix, Arizona resident Benjamin Franklin Cook (Cook).  The Dennel scheme, which centered around the offer and sale of non-existent prime bank securities, bilked investors of approximately $46 million before the Commission halted it in March 1999 through an emergency action in District Court., On June 22, 2000, District Court Judge Jerry Buchmeyer of the Northern District of Texas granted the request of the Commission and the Court-appoint Receiver to place in receivership all assets of Burr and several entities he had created to conceal funds and property obtained through the Dennel scheme. As a result of this Receivership Order, the Receiver seized a house and other assets owned or controlled by Burr.  Recently, however, the Commission and Receiver learned that Burr had continued his unlawful conduct through the subsequent offer and sale of fraudulent investments similar to those offered and sold by Dennel.  Moreover, it appeared that Burr and others were again misappropriating funds and accumulating assets, including homes and automobiles, in the names of various entities controlled by Burr, family members and associates.  , On June 25, 2003, Judge Buchmeyer granted a freeze of assets obtained as a consequence of Burrs additional fraudulent conduct and expanded the Receivership to include new entities created by Burr and other persons involved in the additional fraud.  On the same day, while the Receiver seized real estate, vehicles and other property accumulated by Burr and others, agents of the North Carolina Securities Division arrested Burr and his brother and served search warrants at the homes of Robert and Daniel Burr., In addition to the charges brought by North Carolina, Burr still faces sentencing in connection with criminal charges brought against him by state of Arizona for his participation in the <i>Dennel </i>scheme.  Burr pled guilty to two counts of Fraudulent Schemes and Artifices and agreed to make $4.9 million in restitution in the Arizona case., Burr was also briefly incarcerated in Seagoville Federal Detention Center in Seagoville, Texas, based on an order of contempt issued in the Commissions action.  The Commission and Receiver have since discovered that Burr was apparently perpetrating a $5 million fraudulent transaction during the period of his incarceration in federal prison., Lit.

Lee (Lee) liable for participating in the fraudulent offering of securities of three related companies.  The court granted the Securities and Exchange Commissions motion for summary judgment against Lee, finding that Lee violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court permanently enjoined Lee from future violations of the antifraud and registration provisions of the securities laws, ordered Lee to disgorge $8,050 of ill-gotten gains derived from his fraudulent conduct, plus $2,641.13 in pre-judgment interest, and ordered Lee to pay a civil penalty of $25,000., In its complaint, the Commission charged Lee, along with Jean Baptiste Jean Pierre (Jean Pierre) and Gabriel Toks Pearse (Pearse), with participating in the fraudulent offering and selling of limited partnerships interests of JB Stanley Group, LP (JB Stanley), an unregistered hedge fund, and stock of JB Stanleys general partner, Cambridge Capital Holdings Management, LLC (Cambridge), and Cambridges wholly-owned subsidiary, Union Transfer and Cargo Corporation (UTC), all of which were controlled by Jean Pierre.  None of the offerings were registered with the Commission.  Through these schemes, the defendants raised approximately $407,700 from at least fifteen investors, the majority of which was misappropriated by defendant Jean Pierre, with Lee receiving at least $8,050 from the offering proceeds.  , The Commission alleged that Lee participated in the fraud by making numerous oral misrepresentations concerning the JB Stanley and Cambridge offerings, including that: (1) JB Stanley and Cambridge would conduct an initial public offering (IPO), at a specific price, with JB Stanley investors being able to sell their shares for a profit; (2) Jean Pierre had consistently achieved a 50% return from other funds that he managed; and (3) that JB Stanley is a hedge fund and money or asset management firm that pooled investor funds to purchase and sell securities.  The Commission also alleged that Lee knew that a series of fraudulent written materials were being mailed to potential investors.  The Commission further alleged that Lee did not investigate any of the offerings before soliciting investors and ignored red flags that a fraud was occurring.  , Although Lee defaulted in response to the Commissions motion, the court separately found that on the basis of the evidence submitted, the Commission was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  The court previously entered judgments against the other defendants in this action.  On March 5, 2003, the court entered a default judgment against Jean Pierre, permanently enjoining him from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, ordering Jean Pierre to pay $589,809.32, representing $407,700 in ill-gotten gains derived from his fraudulent conduct plus prejudgment interest of $182,809.32, and ordering him to pay a $407,000 civil penalty.

Carter of the United States District Court for the Central District of California granted the Commissions motion for summary judgment and entered a Final Judgment Of Permanent Injunction And Other Relief Against Jerry A. Womack.  Womack is permanently enjoined from violating the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act.  Under the terms of the Final Judgment, Womack is also required to pay disgorgement in the amount of $18,993,869.06, plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty in the amount of $110,000., In November 2000, the Commission charged Womack with committing securities fraud in offering and selling $19 million in securities to about 400 investors nationwide between August 1997 and June 1999.  Womack represented to investors that he would invest their money in the stock market pursuant to an investment strategy that he claimed to have developed and used successfully called the Womack Dow Principle.  He also represented to investors that, to implement the Womack Dow Principle, he had retained traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.  Additionally, Womack represented to investors that the trading activity was yielding profitable results.  , In fact, Womack utilized only about a quarter of the investors money for securities trading and suffered a net loss on that trading.  Womack misused the majority of investor funds for personal and unrelated expenses and to pay some investors their purported profits and principal.  Among other things, Womack used the funds to purchase homes, real property, artwork, jewelry and cars, and to pay for his honeymoon, cosmetic surgery for his wife, and his divorce settlement.  , In May 2001, Womack was convicted of wire fraud and money laundering in a criminal proceeding brought by the United States Attorneys Office for the Central District of California, arising out of the same facts as the Commissions case.  Also on June 30, 2003, the Honorable David O.

Bentz of Loveland, Ohio, to jointly pay $17.4 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and to pay an additional $110,000 each in civil penalties for their role in defrauding investors through a prime bank trading scheme. Judge Hamilton also ordered Steadfast Ministries, Inc., a Cincinnati, Ohio charitable organization incorporated by Brinker and others, to pay $265,300 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest for funds the company received from the scheme., In February 2001, the Commission sued Brinker, Bentz, and other defendants for operating the fraudulent scheme that raised $20.3 million from over 600 investors. At the same time, Judge Hamilton issued a permanent injunction that prohibits Brinker, Bentz, and other defendants from engaging in fraud and other misconduct in violation of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 15(a), and 15(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5 and 15c1-2 thereunder. Brinker and Bentz consented to the injunction order without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint. , The injunction order also froze the assets of Brinker, Bentz, and the other defendants. In previous civil contempt proceedings, the Commission alleged that shortly before the asset freeze, Bentz obtained approximately $142,000 by borrowing against his assets, and that after the freeze, he spent all or part of the borrowed funds in violation of the freeze.

Greene, Carnegies former chief financial officer, Scott Caruthers, a former Carnegie director, and Dashielle Lashra Caruthers, the wife of Scott Caruthers.  The Caruthers are also named as relief defendants.  All the defendants except Gable have consented to the entry of final judgments in settlement of this matter., The Commissions complaint alleges, among other things, that Gable, Farkas, and Pearl carried out a financial fraud at Carnegie that resulted in Carnegie improperly reporting revenue and income on three transactions in filings with the Commission.  The transactions related to Carnegies sale of a former subsidiary, Electronic Card Acceptance Corporation, and certain business assets of a second subsidiary, Talidan Limited, and its granting of distribution rights to a telephone voice-recognition product called MAVIS.  The filings at issue are the companys original and amended registration statements, filed in October 1998 and February 1999, respectively, and its original and amended 1998 Form 10-KSB annual report, filed in April 1999 and January 2000, respectively.  , The complaint further alleges that Carnegie senior management arranged for the sale of Carnegie shares through management-controlled entities, and had proceeds from these sales transferred to Carnegie as purported payment on certain of these transactions.  According to the complaint, Carnegies accounting for these transactions, and the companys failure to make required disclosures concerning these transactions, including the involvement of related parties, was not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).   The complaint further alleges that Carnegies financial reporting was highly susceptible to the financial fraud because Greene, Carnegies former chief financial officer, failed to implement an adequate system of internal accounting controls.  , Carnegie is also alleged to have materially misrepresented Talidans expected future performance in the companys 1998 Form 10-KSB, by failing to disclose known adverse events and uncertainties that were materially impacting Talidans revenues.  Finally, the company is alleged to have materially misrepresented the terms of other purported MAVIS distribution agreements in press releases issued in 1998.  , According to the complaint, Gable and Pearl, along with the Caruthers, personally benefited from this fraud by selling Carnegie shares at inflated prices through an offshore trust, and they failed to make required disclosures concerning their beneficial ownership and sales of Carnegie shares.   , Based on the facts alleged, the Commission charged the following violations:, Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, all of the defendants except Gable have agreed to settle the Commissions charges by consenting to the entry of final judgments that, if approved by the Court, would permanently enjoin them from further violations of the securities laws.  In addition, Farkas and Pearl have consented to be permanently barred from serving as officers or directors of any public company.  The Court judgments would not impose civil penalties or disgorgement obligations on the settling individual defendants and relief defendants based on the sworn representations each of them made to the Commission regarding his or her financial condition.  With regard to Gable, the Commissions complaint seeks the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, permanently barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and ordering him to pay disgorgement (with prejudgment interest) and civil penalties. , In a related administrative proceeding instituted on July 14, 2003, the Commission issued an order revoking Carnegies stock registration pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(j) based on the companys failure to file with the Commission any periodic reports required by Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 for reporting periods after September 30, 2001.  See <i>In the Matter of Carnegie International Corporation</i>, <a href=/litigation/admin/34-48170.htm>Admin. Proc. 3-11177</a> (July 14, 2003).

(Freedom Surf).  Freedom Surf was then a start-up company with offices in Huntington Beach, California.  The Complaint alleged that certain defendants transferred Freedom Surf stock at no cost to defendant Allen Wolfson.  Wolfson, Kirkpatrick and other defendants then participated in a scheme to artificially run up the price of Freedom Surf stock.  The Complaint alleged that Kirkpatrick and others advanced the bid quotation in Freedom Surf stock without relation to genuine market demand or worth of the company.  Further, Kirkpatrick and other defendants made arranged purchases and sales among brokerage accounts that Wolfson controlled.  The Complaint also alleged that Kirkpatrick made unregistered sales of securities.

Ore.)</h2>]","[On July 16, 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint in federal district court in Portland, Oregon, against Daniel D. Dyer, age 49 and a resident of University Place, Washington, and his wholly owned company, Oxbow Capital Partners, LLC (Oxbow Partners), based in Tacoma, Washington.  The Commissions complaint alleges that the defendants aided and abetted a massive Ponzi scheme perpetrated by Capital Consultants, LLC, formerly an investment adviser in Portland, Oregon.  The Commission previously sued Capital Consultants and its principals for fraud in September 2000.  , The Commissions complaint alleges that Dyer and Oxbow Partners helped Capital Consultants conceal from its clients the failure of a loan made by the former investment adviser.  In November 1998, the borrower of a $160 million loan from Capital Consultants announced that it was having financial problems and stopped making loan payments.  In December 1998, the defendants purchased from Capital Consultants the failed loan at its full $160 million principal balance but were unable to make scheduled monthly payments.  From July 1999 to August 2000, Dyer and Oxbow Partners entered into a series of complex transactions involving Capital Consultants and two entities controlled by Timothy B. Gamwell that resulted in new client funds being used to repay clients invested in the failed loan.  During the scheme, the defendants knew that Capital Consultants made misrepresentations to its clients about Dyer and Oxbow Partners role in purchasing the failed loan., The Commission also charges Dyer and Oxbow Partners with fraud in connection with two securities offerings.  The defendants promoted and managed Oxbow Capital 1999 Fund I, LLC (Oxbow Fund I), an investment fund that raised $4.6 million from over 130 investors between April and October 1999.  The Commissions complaint alleges that the defendants failed to disclose to investors that Oxbow Fund Is first investment would be to purchase an interest in the failed Capital Consultants loan and instead hyped another investment.  The defendants also defrauded investors by agreeing to replace Oxbow Fund Is investment in the failed Capital Consultants loan with securities that the defendants did not own., The defendants second fraudulent offering was Washington Motorcycle Partners, LLC (Washington Partners), which raised about $4 million from over 200 investors between August 1999 and September 2000.  Instead of purchasing stock in a motorcycle company as represented to investors, the defendants used the proceeds from the unregistered Washington Partners offering to enrich themselves and make payments on the failed Capital Consultants loan., The Commissions complaint alleges that Dyer and Oxbow Partners violated the securities registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and violated and aided and abetted violations of the investment advisory antifraud provisions of Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  In its action, the Commission seeks a final judgment against Dyer and Oxbow Partners enjoining them from future violations of the above provisions and ordering them to disgorge all ill-gotten gains and pay a civil penalty., In a related matter, the Commission instituted a public cease-and-desist proceeding against Timothy B. Gamwell, a resident of Key Biscayne, Florida, pursuant to Section 203(k) of the Advisers Act.  Simultaneously with the institution of the proceeding, Gamwell submitted an Offer of Settlement in which, while neither admitting nor denying the Commissions findings, he consented to the entry of an order requiring him to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 206(2) of the Advisers Act., In September 2000, the Commission charged Capital Consultants and its principals, Jeffrey L. Grayson and his son, Barclay L. Grayson, with fraud and obtained emergency relief against them, including the appointment of a receiver over Capital Consultants.  On April 30, 2001, the United States District Court for the District of Oregon entered permanent injunctions against Capital Consultants and the Graysons.  On February 26 and December 5, 2002, amended judgments of permanent injunction were entered against Barclay and Jeffrey Grayson, respectively, that did not assess a civil penalty against them based upon their demonstrated inability to pay.  On November 20, 2001, Barclay Grayson was sentenced to two years in prison in a related criminal action.

The judgment provides that Brotherton and IBC are jointly and severally liable for the judgment debt totaling $411,746.03.  The Court also resolved other pending motions in favor of the Commission and vacated a trial date previously set by the court.  In previous orders, the Court had granted the Commissions motions for a default judgment against IBC and for summary judgment against Brotherton, though the Court denied the Commissions request for injunctive relief against Brotherton, The Commissions complaint, filed July 13, 2001, alleged that Brotherton and IBC raised over $300,000 by selling IBC stock without registration to over 180 investors between January and July of 2001.

</h2>]","[<i>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION V. CARL STEVENS et al.</i>, 03-CV-5318 (R.B.) (S.D.N.Y.), The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it has filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against eighteen defendants on charges of insider trading in the shares of PrimeSource Corporation (PSRC), a graphic arts dealer.  The complaint alleges that the defendants purchased PSRC stock after receiving confidential information that Fuji Photo Film, U.S.A., Inc. (Fuji) was planning to acquire PSRC.  The defendants are individuals associated with two other Fuji graphic arts dealers - H.A. Metzger, Inc. (Metzger) and London Litho Aluminum Company, Inc. (London Litho) - and their tippees.  The Commissions complaint also names two relief defendants who received profits from the illicit trades.  To settle the case, the eighteen defendants have consented to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud and insider trading provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), to disgorge illicit profits plus prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties.  The relief defendants have consented to disgorge their illicit profits plus prejudgment interest.  , The complaint alleges that the defendants, who traded before Fuji announced its takeover of PSRC on August 31, 2001, essentially comprise two insider trading rings, the Metzger Ring and the London Litho Ring.  Trading by the defendants and the relief defendants resulted in illicit per-person profits ranging from as much as $89,500 to as little as $4,200.  In some cases, the defendants mistakenly believed that they would avoid detection if they or their tippees limited their illegal trades to low-volume purchases.  , <b><i>Metzger Ring.</i></b>  The Commissions complaint alleges that in May 2001, Fuji representatives told Carl Stevens (Stevens), then president of Metzger, that Fuji was negotiating to acquire PSRC.  In June 2001, Stevens told two Metzger executives, Steven Lauria (Lauria) and Roger Oley (Oley), and a Metzger sales representative, Michael Susi (Susi), about Fujis acquisition plans.  Stevens and these three other Metzger employees signed a confidentiality agreement with Fuji.  These individuals breached that agreement by buying PSRC stock - in the case of Stevens, Lauria, Oley and Susi - and by tipping others who traded - in the case of Stevens, Oley, and Susi.  Stevens tipped Frank Trupia (Trupia), Stevens son-in-law; Lawrence Read (Read), president of Read &amp; Co. (another Fuji graphic arts dealer); and Alfred Lake (Lake), a Metzger sales representative.  Trupia and Read bought PSRC in their own accounts; Lake bought PSRC in accounts controlled by his sons - relief defendants Peter Lake and Paul Lake - for the benefit of his grandchildren.  Oley tipped his father-in-law, Yngvar Haslestad (Haslestad).  Susi tipped his brother-in-law and son-in-law.  Another Metzger sales representative Ron Jasser (Jasser) traded in the shares of PSRC by providing money to two of his friends, Anthony Viola (Viola) and Mark Kaplan (Kaplan), and directing them to purchase shares of PSRC.  Viola and Kaplan purchased shares of PSRC using Jassers money and their own, and provided Jasser with his share of the profits from the trades., The complaint further alleges that Stevens told several individuals at Metzger that he had traded, suggested that they trade, and boasted that he would not get caught because he was too far removed from Fuji or PSRC to be detected.  Stevens also told one defendant not to buy a large quantity of shares because it was insider trading, but suggested that a small trade would slip under the radar and not be detected.  Stevens told another defendant: Small quantities would probably not be a problem in terms of visibility.  But then small quantities might not be worth the exposure for just small profits.  All told, trading by Metzger associates and their tippees resulted in illicit profits of at least $276,500.  , <b><i>London Litho Ring.</i></b> The Commissions complaint alleges that in April 2001, Fuji representatives told Eric London (London), president of London Litho, about Fujis plans to acquire PSRC.

The Complaint alleges that approximately $1 million of new investor money was used to pay obligations to existing investors for their recruitment of new investors., The Complaint also alleges that defendants solicited investors through a combination of false and misleading representations, including false promises of great riches (up to $160,000 per month return on a $25 investment), as well as false representations concerning the company, the participation of advertisers and other website vendors, and the sources and availability of financial backing.

Rent-Way, Inc., et al.</i>, 03 CIV 231E (JSM) (W.D.PA.)</h2>]","[The Commission announced today that it has brought securities fraud charges against two former senior officers of Rent-Way, Inc. (Rent-Way or the Company), one of the largest rent-to-own companies in the United States, in connection with a scheme that caused Rent-Way to under-report expenses and substantially inflate reported earnings in 1999 and 2000.  In addition, the Complaint charges Rent-Way with corporate reporting and record keeping violations and charges another former employee with record keeping violations. The Commission further announced that, simultaneously with the filing of the Complaint, it settled the charges against three of the defendants and partially settled the charges against the fourth defendant., The Complaint alleges that, during fiscal 1999 and 2000, Rent-Way under-reported a variety of expenses by approximately $60 million.  Each of Rent-Ways Forms 10-Q and Form 10-K filed in fiscal 1999 and 2000 overstated pre-tax earnings or understated pre-tax loss by between 12%-448%.  In addition, approximately $35 million in fraudulent entries made to Rent-Ways books and records in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 were discovered prior to any public dissemination of the Companys financial results for that quarter.  Jeffrey Conway (Conway), Rent-Ways former president, CFO, COO and a director, and Matthew Marini (Marini), Rent-Ways former controller and chief accounting officer, directed the fraudulent scheme.  Conway directed Marini to meet periodic earnings forecasts that Conway set, and Marini directed lower level employees to make fraudulent entries to Rent-Ways books and records.  Conway also directed Jeffrey Underwood (Underwood), Rent-Ways former senior vice president in charge of operations, to defer the recording of certain operating expenses at the end of fiscal 1999 and 2000.  The effect was to inflate falsely and substantially the Companys financial results. , The defendants are as follows:, <b>Rent-Way</b> is a Pennsylvania corporation with its principal executive offices in Erie, Pennsylvania.  Its common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. , <b>Conway</b>, age 45, was the chief financial officer of Rent-Way from February 1992 through September 1999 and president and chief operating officer of Rent-Way from September 1999 until he resigned in December 2000.  Conway also served as a director from February 2000 until he resigned in December 2000.  Conway is a certified public accountant. , <b>Marini</b>, age 38, was the controller of Rent-Way from October 1995 to December 1999 and the chief accounting officer from December 1999 until he was terminated in October 2000. , <b>Underwood</b>, age 46, was the senior vice president in charge of operations overseeing all of Rent-Ways operations from September 1999 to July 2002.     , The Complaint alleges as follows: , Beginning in December 1998, Conway directed Marini to do whatever was necessary to ensure that the Company met its earnings guidance but not to tell Conway how he was meeting the earnings guidance so that Conway could maintain plausible deniability (<i>i.e.,</i> the ability to deny direct knowledge of the misconduct).  Beginning in December 1999, Marini told Conway the details of his fraudulent conduct and continued to discuss with Conway details of his ongoing efforts to meet the Companys earnings guidance. Conway condoned and encouraged Marinis actions.  , Marini systematically understated Rent-Ways operating expenses across many corporate-level accounts and also inflated the Companys miscellaneous and other income accounts. Marini accomplished this by directing lower level accounting employees to make unsupported and false entries to the Companys corporate general ledger. , Conway also directed Underwood to defer improperly the recording of certain rental merchandise related losses at the end of fiscal 1999 and 2000 for the sole purpose of meeting the Companys earnings targets. , When the fraudulent scheme began to unravel in October 2000, Conway and Marini took overt steps to conceal the manipulation from the auditors and from other officers of the Company.  For example, in order to bring a store-level rental merchandise account into balance with the corporate level general ledger that had been manipulated, Marini directed an employee to add back to the store-level point of sale system approximately $16 million in rental merchandise losses that had been written off in an earlier quarter. When the employee refused, Conway directed the employee to follow Marinis instructions.  Conway also directed another employee to misrepresent to the CFO the true nature of the discrepancy in the accounts, and Conway and Marini later concocted a false explanation of the problem in order to prevent any further investigation by the CFO. , The Complaint further alleges that in May 2000, Conway engaged in illegal insider trading by selling 6,500 shares of Rent-Way stock at a time when he had nonpublic information about the true financial condition of the Company and the fraudulent scheme., The Commission alleges that, as a result of the foregoing, Rent-Way violated Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 promulgated thereunder; Conway and Marini violated  Sections 10(b) and 13b-5 of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and are also liable as control persons of Rent-Way under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act for Rent-Ways violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13; and that Underwood violated Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1.   , The Commission seeks a Final Judgment (i) permanently enjoining each defendant from future violations of the securities laws; (ii) ordering Conway to pay disgorgement plus prejudgment interest; (iii) imposing civil penalties against Conway, Marini and Underwood; and (iv) barring Conway and Marini from serving as an officer or director of a public company. , The Company has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the Company from further violations of the reporting and books and records provisions of the federal securities law.  In determining to accept Rent-Ways settlement offer, the Commission considered that Rent-Way undertook remedial actions and cooperated with Commission staff. , Defendant Conway has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from further violations of the antifraud, reporting and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws; permanently bars him from serving as an officer or a director of a public company; and orders him to pay $129,350 in disgorgement of the loss he avoided on his sale of Rent-Way stock plus $30,067 in prejudgment interest, and a $200,000 civil penalty.  , Defendant Marini has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from further violations of the antifraud, reporting and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws, and that permanently bars him from serving as an officer or a director of a public company.  The amount of any civil penalty that Marini must pay is left open to a later determination.  , Defendant Underwood has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from further violations of the books and records provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $25,000., The offers of settlement by the defendants will be submitted to the Court for its approval., The Commission thanks the United States Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for their assistance to its investigation.  In a separate action, Conway, Marini and Underwood each pleaded guilty to a criminal information for their respective roles in the fraudulent scheme. , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18241.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18241.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The examination at issue began in May 2003.  According to the complaint, as part of the examination Commission examiners asked Schield Management to produce certain e-mails for their inspection.  After the request was made, Marshall Schield directed two of the firms employees to destroy e-mails responsive to the request.  The complaint also alleges that Commission examiners asked Schield Management to produce the firms log of trading errors.  Schield Management responded by producing several different, inconsistent versions of the log, none of which is complete or accurate.

On July 22, 2003, the Honorable Kathleen M. OMalley, Judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio issued a judgment that enjoins Fruchtenbaum from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; orders him to pay disgorgement of $79,437, prejudgment interest of $28,711, and a civil penalty of $238,311, for a total of $346,459; and prohibits him from serving as an officer or director of a publicly held company for five years.    , The Commission filed its complaint against Fruchtenbaum on May 1, 2002.  The case arose from Fruchtenbaums unlawful sale of American Greetings common stock while he was a director, the president and the chief operating officer of the company.  American Greetings, headquartered in suburban Cleveland, Ohio, is in the business of creating, manufacturing and distributing greeting cards and social expression products.  , The Commissions Complaint alleged that in November 1998, Fruchtenbaum learned from internal company forecasts that in the upcoming fiscal year American Greetings revenues and earnings were likely to fall materially short of both public expectations and the companys own strategic forecasts.  The Commission charged that in December 1998 Fruchtenbaum used this information to exercise options to buy American Greetings stock and then sell the acquired shares in same-day, cashless transactions.  The options Fruchtenbaum exercised in December 1998 were all the vested options he held at the time.  The Commission alleged that Fruchtenbaum sold his shares after the chief executive officer and the general counsel of American Greetings admonished him not to do so.  On February 24, 1999, American Greetings publicly announced that it expected revenues and earnings for the next fiscal year to be materially below prior expectations.  That day, the price of the companys stock fell approximately 32%, from $35.0625 to $23.875.  The Commission alleged that Fruchtenbaum avoided material losses by selling his shares of American Greetings stock before the public announcement of the revenue and earnings forecasts.

The Commissions complaint alleges that the fraud has taken place since June 2000 and involves the unregistered offer and sale of securities of Tecumseh and Tecumsehs subsidiary, Defendant Tecumseh Tradevest LLC (Tradevest).  Tecumseh and Tradevest have conducted the fraud largely through the efforts of Defendant John L. Milling, a securities lawyer and Tecumsehs senior official.

Morgan Chase &amp; Co.</i>, Case No. H-03-28-77 (MH) (S.D. Tx.)</h2>, <h2>J.P. Morgan Chase Simultaneously Settles Charges for $135 Million</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) today charged J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. with aiding and abetting Enron Corp.s securities fraud.  The Commissions complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Houston, alleges that J.P. Morgan Chase aided and abetted Enrons manipulation of its reported financial results through a series of complex structured finance transactions, called prepays, over a period of several years preceding Enrons bankruptcy.  These transactions were used by Enron to report loans from J.P. Morgan Chase as cash from operating activities.  The structural complexity of these transactions had no business purpose aside from masking the fact that, in substance, they were loans from J.P. Morgan Chase to Enron.  Between December 1997 and September 2001, J.P. Morgan Chase effectively loaned Enron a total of approximately $2.6 billion in the form of seven such transactions., Simultaneous with the filing of the complaint, J.P. Morgan Chase agreed to file a consent and final judgment settling the Commissions action against it.  In the consent, J.P. Morgan Chase has agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.  J.P. Morgan Chase also has agreed to pay disgorgement, penalties and interest in the amount of $135 million.  The Commission intends to have these funds paid into a court account pursuant to the Fair Fund provisions of Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for ultimate distribution to victims of the fraud., Specifically, the complaint alleges that between December 1997 and Enrons demise in 2001, J.P. Morgan Chase and Enron engaged in seven of these prepay transactions in order to disguise loans as commodity trades thus achieving Enrons desired accounting and reporting objectives.  As the complaint alleges, the clearest indication that the J.P. Morgan Chase/Enron prepays were disguised loans was their structure.  In general, in a prepay transaction (also known as a prepaid forward sale contract) the purchaser pays for a commodity upfront, in full, at the time the contract is made, and the seller agrees to deliver the subject commodity on future dates, often over the course of several years.  In effect, the seller bets that the market price of the subject commodity would be lower at the time of delivery than at the time the contract is made.  The purchaser bets the opposite way:  that the market price of the commodity at the time of delivery will exceed the price it paid at the time of contracting.  In a typical prepay transaction, therefore, each side assumes commodity price risk. , According to the complaint, the critical difference in the J.P. Morgan Chase/Enron prepays -- and the reason that these transactions were in substance loans -- was that they employed a structure that passed the counter-party commodity price risk back to Enron, thus eliminating all commodity risk from the transaction.  This was accomplished through a series of simultaneous trades whereby Enron passed the counter-party commodity price risk to a J.P. Morgan Chase-sponsored special purpose vehicle called Mahonia, which passed the risk to J.P. Morgan Chase, which, in turn, passed the risk back to Enron.  , As in typical prepays, the complaint alleges, Enron received cash upfront.  In contrast to typical prepays, according to the complaint, with all elements of the structure taken together, Enrons future obligations were reduced to the repayment of cash it received from J.P. Morgan Chase with negotiated interest.  The interest was calculated with reference to LIBOR.  Since all price risk and, in certain transactions, even the obligation to transport a commodity were eliminated, the only risk in the transactions was Chases risk that Enron would not make its payments when due, <i>i.e.</i>, credit risk.   In short, the complaint alleges, these seven prepays were in substance loans. , According to the complaint, Mahonia was included in the structure solely to effectuate Enrons accounting and financial reporting objectives.  Enron told J.P. Morgan Chase that Enron needed Mahonia in the transactions for Enrons accounting.  Mahonia was controlled by Chase and was directed by Chase to participate in the transactions ostensibly as a separate, independent, commodities-trading entity.  As the complaint further alleges, in order to facilitate Enrons accounting objectives, J.P. Morgan Chase took various steps to make it appear that Mahonia was an independent third party., The Commission alleges that J.P. Morgan Chase knew that Enron engaged in prepays to match its so-called mark-to-market earnings (paper earnings based on changes in the market value of certain assets held by Enron) with cash flow from operating activities.  By matching mark-to-market earnings with cash flow from operating activities, Enron is alleged to have sought to convince analysts and credit rating agencies that its reported mark-to-market earnings were real, <i>i.e.</i>, that the value of the underlying assets would ultimately be converted into cash.  , The Commission further alleges that J.P. Morgan Chase also knew that prepays yielded another substantial benefit to Enron:  they allowed Enron to hide the true extent of its borrowings from investors and rating agencies because sums borrowed in prepay transactions appeared as price risk management liabilities rather than debt on Enrons balance sheet.  In addition, Enrons obligation to repay those sums was not otherwise disclosed.  Significantly, according to the Commissions allegations, J.P. Morgan Chase considered prepays to be unsecured loans to Enron, rather than commodity trading contracts, and based its decisions to participate in these transactions primarily on its assessment of Enrons credit., The Commission brought this action in coordination with the New York County District Attorneys Office.  The Commission also acknowledges the assistance of the Federal Reserve and the New York State Banking Department., The Commissions investigation is continuing.  , For additional information, see, <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18252.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18252.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Mr. Hilker and Mr. Baker raised these funds by offering and selling PDL and HBI securities to investors located throughout several states. , In raising these funds, the defendants made numerous false statements to investors, primarily concerning the use of investor proceeds.  In fact, only approximately $1.7 million of the funds raised were actually used for the purchase and development of the Dacono property.  The remaining $3 million of investor proceeds was used by Mr. Hilker and Mr. Baker for their own personal use, was diverted to alter ego entities they controlled, was invested in risky business ventures unrelated to the Dacono property and was used for payment of Ponzi-type interest payments to other investors. , The Commission alleged that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws set forth in Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

In January 2003, the Commission brought a civil injunctive action against Potter and his son in connection with the same trading., In connection with his earlier guilty plea, Potter acknowledged that, on October 18, 2000, his son, Timothy J. Potter, disclosed to him confidential information concerning adverse developments relating to (R)-fluoxetine, a pharmaceutical drug then being jointly developed by Sepracor and Eli Lilly and Company.  At the time, Timothy Potter was employed in Sepracors accounting department.  Potter further admitted that, minutes later, he used that information to purchase put options for Sepracor stock.  The purchase of a put option, which gives its purchaser the right to sell the underlying stock at a predetermined price by a certain date, is essentially a bet that the price of the underlying securities will decline.  , When Sepracor and Eli Lilly publicly announced the adverse developments the following morning, Sepracors stock price plummeted while the value of Sepracors put options soared. Hours after the announcements, Potter sold the Sepracor put options, generating an overnight profit of more than $55,000.  Potter admitted that he later transferred that profit to Timothy Potter.  Potter also admitted that he attempted to mislead the Commission staff in sworn testimony he provided in an investigation the staff was conducting into his trades., United States District Judge Steven J.

Without admitting or denying the SECs allegations in its complaint, Yadegar consented to the entry of judgment in favor of the SEC on its complaint that Yadegar aided and abetted Unify and two of its former officers to violate certain anti-fraud and other provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and agreed to pay a $50,000 civil penalty.  In addition, Arsin and Yadegar consented to the issuance of a SEC administrative order finding that they caused such violations, and which directed them to cease and desist from causing any future violations, in a separate administrative proceeding instituted on July 17., According to the SECs Complaint, on two occasions in 2000 Yadegar caused Arsin to enter into contracts that purchased, in total, $1 million of software license rights from Unify.  At the time Arsin entered into the contracts with Unify, it lacked the funds to pay for the software.  According to the Complaint, in each instance Yadegar provided Unify with a check for the entire amount of the purchase, with the understanding that Unify would show the check to Unifys independent auditors and that Unify would not deposit Arsins check until Unify had provided Arsin with the funds necessary to cover Arsins check.  Arsin later used funds it received from Unify to pay for the software.  Unify initially recognized revenue on the transactions with Arsin, and filed a Form 10-Q for the quarter ended January 31, 2000 and an earnings release for the year ended April 30, 2000 that improperly included this revenue.  Later, following an internal investigation, Unify reversed approximately $950,000 of the revenue, as part of a larger restatement of its financial results.  The SECs Complaint alleges that by engaging in such conduct, Yadegar aided and abetted Unifys violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13, and aided and abetted violations by two former Unify officers of Exchange Act Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5), and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2.

Fisch and Gregory were told that disappointing news by their supervisor during a conference call on the morning of July 8, 2002.  Despite being told during the call and by e-mail that the information they were receiving was confidential and would not be made public until the following day, Fisch and Gregory sold their entire holdings of Wyeth stock shortly after learning the negative news., On July 8, Fisch sold 3,000 shares of Wyeth stock at $49 a share, for a total of $147,000, and Gregory sold 1,000 shares at $49.16 a share for a total of $9,160.

The Commission also today instituted settled administrative proceedings against Rathi and Pennington, finding that each of them violated the federal securities laws by engaging in a fraudulent, tax-motivated wash sales trading scheme.  , The Commissions Complaint alleges, and its administrative Order finds, that both Rathi and Pennington separately employed a trading scheme designed to create artificial tax losses.  As detailed in the Commissions Order, Rathi and Pennington placed near-simultaneous matching limit orders to buy and sell the same security in their respective taxable and tax-sheltered accounts.  Often, these matching limit orders were placed at prices that were far away from the existing market price in order to create tax losses while still retaining ownership of the stock being traded.  Rathi and Pennington were able to match up their respective limit orders at artificial prices by trading illiquid stocks in the less liquid after-hours market using the Island ECN  and thereby taking advantage of the fragmented nature of the after-hours market.  , The Order finds that Rathis and Penningtons wash sales created an appearance of market activity, were effected at contrived prices, and did not reflect the supply and demand for the stocks they were trading.  In the aggregate, Rathi and Pennington executed 155 wash sales between their respective taxable and tax-deferred accounts.  All but three of these wash sales were executed in the after-hours market.  This trading scheme was employed by Rathi and Pennington during the fourth quarter of 1999 and involved the securities of over 30 different issuers.  As a result of this scheme, Rathi and Pennington created artificial tax losses in their taxable accounts of $221,698 and $77,662, respectively., In the federal court action, Rathi and Pennington have each consented, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions Complaint, to the entry of a final judgment that requires each of them to pay a $10,000 penalty.  In the Commissions administrative proceedings, each of them have consented, without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, to the entry of an order requiring them to cease and desist from violating the antifraud provisions contained within Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  <i>In re Dwarka P.

The sentence followed a guilty verdict on multiple counts of wire fraud, mail fraud and securities fraud after an eight-week jury trial that concluded in 2002.  Five other people were either convicted or pleaded guilty during the criminal trial.  Sentencing of the defendants is presently set to conclude in August 2003. , The prime bank scheme raised over $74 million from at least 3,200 U.S. and Canadian victims.  In May 2000, the Commission filed a complaint seeking emergency relief, including an asset freeze and injunctive relief.  The Court granted this relief on May 10, 2000.  The Commissions injunctive complaint, as amended in August 2000, names as defendants Zidar, Elizabeth Anne Phillips and John Wesley Matthews, as well as ten relief defendants.

The complaint alleges that, contrary to these representations, the defendants misappropriated investor money for personal expenses and failed to engage in any profitable investments.  The Commissions complaint further alleges that at least 25% of the investors money was diverted to pay sales commissions to various salespersons and agents in a multi-level marketing scheme through which the Oakleaf and Rosewood programs were sold.  , In the civil case, which has been stayed pending the resolution of the parallel criminal action, the Commission also obtained the appointment of a Receiver to marshal assets and distribute them back to defrauded investors.

Mohr (Mohr), formerly of Wayne, Pennsylvania, for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The Commissions complaint alleges that, from at least June 1993 until the fall of 2001, Mohr knowingly engaged in a ponzi scheme in which he obtained approximately $9.6 million from 87 investors.  Mohr misappropriated the funds for his personal use and to fund payments of principal and purported profits to clients who had invested at earlier points in time.  Over the course of the eight years during which Mohr operated the ponzi scheme, Mohr paid approximately $7.9 million in principal and purported profits to investors and used the remaining $1.7 million for his own personal use.  Ultimately, Mohrs fraudulent scheme resulted in client losses of approximately $3.1 million.  Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint, Mohr settled the action.  Mohr consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  Mohr has also consented to a bar from the investment advisory and broker-dealer industries., The complaint alleges that Mohr, a former registered representative and unregistered investment adviser, solicited investors to become advisory clients and invest funds with him, promising annual returns of as much as 100 to 200 percent.  Mohr represented that he would achieve these high returns by investing client funds in publicly traded securities, primarily equity options, and in futures contracts.  Contrary to his representations, Mohr never invested his clients funds.  Instead, the complaint alleges Mohr deposited the funds into his personal checking account and used the funds for his own personal use and to make payments of principal and purported profits to earlier investors.   , The complaint further alleges that Mohr executed investment agreements with each of his clients, which purported to set forth the terms of the arrangement under which he would take custody of and invest their funds.  In addition, Mohr concealed his theft of funds by furnishing his clients with fictitious account statements that falsely reported securities transactions that had never occurred.  Ultimately, Mohrs scheme collapsed.  In the fall of 2001, Mohr stopped communicating with his clients.  On January 10, 2002, Mohr filed for bankruptcy. , The complaint alleges that Mohr violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint also alleges that Mohr violated Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

Klarman with fraud and other misconduct in violation of the federal securities laws.  Hilsenrath is the former Chief Executive Officer and Klarman the former General Counsel for U.S. Wireless Corporation (U.S. WIRELESS), headquartered in San Ramon, California. , The Commissions complaint alleges as follows:  From August 1997 to January 2000, Hilsenrath and Klarman had U.S. WIRELESS transfer common stock worth approximately $3.2 million and cash totaling approximately $428,000 to several offshore entities that they secretly owned and controlled.  The transfers were part of a scheme by Hilsenrath and Klarman to extract assets from U.S. WIRELESS without providing any consideration in return.  In order to conceal their misappropriation of company funds and stock, the defendants caused U.S. WIRELESS to make materially false and misleading statements in its 1998, 1999, and 2000 annual and periodic financial reports filed with the Commission.  Under the direction of Hilsenrath and Klarman, the cash and stock transfers were originally recorded in U.S. WIRELESSs books and financial statements as compensation for services or as the sale of stock for valid consideration.  Hilsenrath and Klarman also made misrepresentations about the transfers to U.S. WIRELESSs auditors.  The defendants also made false statements in at least one Form S-3 filing.  In early 2001, U.S. WIRELESSs Board of Directors received information challenging the validity of the transfers.  Once the unauthorized and illegal character of the transfers was recognized, U.S. WIRELESS restated its financial results for fiscal 2000 to increase its annual net loss from $11.4 million to $17.7 million, or by 35%.  , The Commissions Complaint charges Hilsenrath and Klarman with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.

The Commissions complaint alleges that the executives caused Cutter to fraudulently inflate its financial results for the fiscal quarter and year ended April 30, 2000, by improperly recognizing as revenue $5.7 million in shipments to distributors functioning as Company warehouses, and later concealed the improper transactions from the Companys auditors and shareholders.  In a related matter, the Commission instituted cease-and-desist proceedings against Cutter for alleged violations of the corporate reporting, books and records and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws.  , Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint, Lowber and Hilton agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, consenting to orders permanently barring them from violations of the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws and requiring them to pay civil penalties of $50,000 and $25,000, respectively.  Lowber also consented to the entry of an order barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and an order prohibiting him from practicing before the Commission as an accountant.  Cutter has likewise agreed to the entry of a cease-and-desist order without admitting or denying the Commissions findings., The Commissions complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, alleges that Cutter was encountering declining sales as it approached the end of its fiscal year ended April 30, 2000.  In the final days of April, Hilton, now 46 and residing in Parkville, Missouri, negotiated deals with three distributors under which Cutter would ship them a total of $5.7 million in products.  Hilton struck side deals with the distributors, assuring them that they had no obligation to pay for any of the goods until customers located by Cutter paid the distributors.  Because of Cutters ongoing obligation to complete the sales, revenue recognition was improper under generally accepted accounting principles (known as GAAP).  In press releases and in filings with the Commission that were distributed to the public, Cutter announced revenue of $54.6 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2000 and $152.5 million for the entire fiscal year.  However, because these figures included $5.7 million in improperly recognized revenue on the distributor sales, they overstated Cutters true quarterly and annual revenue by 12% and 4%, respectively., The complaint also charges that Lowber, 52, of Mill Creek, Washington, learned by late 2000 that these distributors were operating as Cutter warehouses and that revenue recognition had been improper.  Rather than restate and correct the companys financial statements, as required under GAAP, Lowber took steps to conceal the transactions from Cutters independent auditors and board of directors.  Lowber arranged for the distributors to return $3.8 million in unsold inventory in early 2001.  According to the complaint, Lowber directed Cutter personnel to override the companys accounting software program and divide the returns among multiple company sales divisions in order to hide the magnitude of the returns.,  Hilton left the company in 2001, and Lowber resigned in August 2002.  On August 12, 2002, Cutter, which had undergone a change in management, announced that it would restate its financial statements for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 as a result of the improper distributor transactions.  The announcement caused Cutters stock price to drop from $4.02 to $3.44, or 14%, the following day. , The complaint charges Hilton and Lowber with securities fraud (Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder) and causing Cutter to report false financial information to the Commission (Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1).  The complaint additionally charges Lowber with lying to accountants (Rule 13b2-2 under the Exchange Act), falsifying the companys books and records (Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder), and causing Cutters failure to maintain accurate books and records and internal controls (Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18276.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

In addition, the judgment ordered WorldCom to undertake extensive reviews of its corporate governance and internal controls, as well as required the company to establish a training and education program for WorldCom officers and employees to minimize the possibility of future violations of the federal securities laws.

The complaint alleges that Sparks, Unistars former chairman and CEO, Clayton, a three-time convicted felon, and Romano, a securities fraud recidivist, engaged in a scheme to fraudulently inflate the value of Unistars stock through false public statements, false Commission filings, and manipulative trades. According to the complaint, their fraudulent conduct in 1998 and 1999 drove Unistars stock price to $61 per share and enabled the company to make the Russell 2000 index.  In July 1999, at the height of the scheme, Unistar, a company that currently has no operations or assets, had a market capitalization of over $1.4 billion.

POWELL, MOVIE PRODUCER AND FORMER STOCKBROKER, INDICTED FOR LYING TO THE SEC</u></b>, On August 5, 2003, a federal grand jury indicted John R. Powell, former President of Irvine Securities, Inc. and currently a movie producer, for making false statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The indictment charges Powell with making false statements to a federal agency and obstruction of justice.  The indictment alleges that during 2002, the Commission proposed settling a civil case filed by the Commission against Powell and others.  During the course of settlement discussions, the Commission staff stated that it would consider waiving a portion of the proposed amount of disgorgement and an additional money penalty if Powell was unable to pay the full amount.  The Commission required Powell to submit sworn financial statements demonstrating his inability to pay.  Powell submitted two sworn financial statements, dated January 2002 and July 2002.  , The indictment alleges that in each of the financial statements, Powell claimed he had a negative net worth and that he had no equity in his Laguna Beach house because his mortgage was essentially equal to the propertys quick sale market value.  The indictment further alleges that Powell, in fact, knew at the time he submitted the January 2002 financial statements that his residence had been appraised at a value of over $3 million, that a mortgage lender would loan him at least $1,750,000 against the property, and that he had at least $500,000 in equity in the property.  In Powells July 2002 financial statements submitted to the Commission, Powell did not disclose that he had refinanced his house in February 2002 to withdraw more than $428,000 in cash from the property.  Nor did the financial statements disclose that Powell deposited this money directly into a bank account in the name of a film production company that Powell owned and controlled.  Powell subsequently wrote checks on this bank account to pay for his monthly mortgage payments and other living expenses., On October 10, 2002, in an action brought by the Commission, the United States District Court for the Central District of California entered an injunction prohibiting Powell from violating the securities registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5.

The Court ordered McMinn to pay disgorgement in the amount of $747,000, plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $198,153.29.  The Court also imposed a civil penalty against McMinn in the amount of $25,000. ,   The complaint in this matter alleged that Dianna Blairtorbett (Blairtorbett), a Tennessee resident and McMinn fraudulently offered and sold unregistered securities by promising extravagant rates of return derived from a variety of investments, including purported prime bank trading programs. The defendants raised approximately $7.7 million from nearly 100 investors in thirteen states and the funds were pooled into accounts owned and controlled by McMinn and Blairtorbett. The complaint also alleged that the defendants made misrepresentations and omissions of material fact to investors concerning, among other things, the touted risk free nature of McMinns investments, the use of investor funds, expected returns and the false representation that McMinns investments were secured by approximately $7 billion in gold and other precious metals. The precious metals did not exist. Furthermore, the complaint alleged that Blairtorbett falsely represented that an initial investment of $50,000 would be worth approximately $1.7 million in three years and $22 million in five years, but that she had no basis for these representations, and that she knowingly or recklessly failed to disclose that a significant percentage of investor funds would be used to pay the returns of earlier investors.

The jury also found Weissman guilty of conspiracy with respect to each of the above counts. , The evidence at trial established that Weissman, the former chief executive officer and chairman of the board of American Bank Note Holographics, Inc. (ABNH) and American Banknote Corporation (ABN), ABNHs former publicly-held parent, and two subordinate ABNH executives fraudulently inflated ABNHs reported revenue and earnings for fiscal years 1996 and 1997 and for the first three fiscal quarters of 1998.  Weissman and his co-conspirators engaged in sham transactions, recognized revenue from sales of holograms before the manufacturing process was even complete, and lied to the companys independent auditors in an effort to conceal the scheme.  The evidence at trial established that in July 1998, Weissman and his co-conspirators, on the basis of this fraudulent financial information, caused ABN to sell the common stock of ABNH to members of the investing public for $115 million.  The evidence established that on January 19, 1999, six months after the ABNH IPO, ABNH announced that it would restate some of its previous financial statements.  Over the following few days, the price of ABNH stock plummeted from approximately $16 a share to approximately $1.80, resulting in a decline of more than $190 million in ABNHs market capitalization. Restated financial statements issued by ABNH in December 1999 revealed that ABNH had overstated its actual net income for 1996 by 11%, and overstated its actual revenue and net income for 1997 by 34% and 169% respectively.  , Weissman, who was convicted on each of the charges above, faces a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison, a fine of $1 million or twice the gross loss or gain resulting from the offense, and mandatory restitution.

Palatin.  The judgment enjoins Palatin, the former chairman and CEO of The Cronos Group, from violating the antifraud, reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 (Section 17(a)) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), 13(b)(5), and Rules 10(b)(5), 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-16, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2).  The judgment also permanently bars Palatin from acting as an officer or director of a public company.  In October 2002, Palatin was convicted on criminal fraud charges in Austria and received a nine year sentence based on his conduct in the interception of payments described below., The court found that Palatin, by his default, was deemed to have admitted the allegations in the Commissions complaint.  The court also held that Palatin caused Cronos to misrepresent or fail to disclose a series of transactions by which he obtained more than $10 million from Cronos or from a customer of the company who owed funds to Cronos.  As a consequence of Palatins misconduct the company misrepresented or failed to disclose the transactions in the companys registration statement, public statements to shareholders, and in filings with the Commission between 1995 and 1998.  Palatin also caused the transactions to be recorded inaccurately in Cronos books and records and he made and caused to be made misrepresentations to the companys auditors.  Cronos, a Luxembourg holding company with its operational headquarters in San Francisco, California, manages and owns marine cargo containers., Specifically, the court found that Palatin caused Cronos to fail to disclose that he intercepted payments between Cronos and one of its major customers (which Palatin also controlled); he caused Cronos to pay him millions of dollars in the year before its initial public offering and recorded the payments as a loan to a third party; and Palatin improperly failed to disclose that he, through another entity that he controlled, sold shares in Cronos IPO.  Following the IPO, Palatin caused Cronos to fail to disclose that it paid additional funds to him immediately after the offering.  Palatin pledged collateral he did not own to secure a loan from the company and he caused the company to make misrepresentations concerning the collateral.  In addition, the court found that Palatin controlled the companys disclosures and was the beneficiary of the transactions that the company misrepresented in its filings and public statements. , For more information, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr16645.htm>16645</a> (August 8, 2000).

On August 11, the Commission obtained an emergency order from Federal District Judge John G. Koeltl in New York, without notice to Zubkis, to seize the yacht and turn it over to a court-appointed receiver before Zubkis could remove it from United States waters.  The receiver is currently holding the yacht in San Diego, pending a final determination by the Court regarding whether to permit the receiver to sell the yacht and apply the sale proceeds toward satisfaction of the Commissions judgment against Zubkis.   , Judge Koeltl previously held Zubkis liable for orchestrating a complex securities fraud scheme involving the use of boiler-room stock sale techniques and other egregious securities fraud violations.  The Court ordered Zubkis to disgorge $21,578,731 in his illicit gains from the scheme, and permanently barred Zubkis from serving as an officer and director of a public company.  Judge Koeltl previously found that, over a period of several years, Mr. Zubkis, as head of [his corporation] Z3, knowingly orchestrated a securities fraud that netted several million dollars and from which he stood to profit personally.  The misrepresentations in this case were egregious.  This is, moreover, not the first time that Mr. Zubkis has been found in violation of securities related rules. , In ordering the yacht seizure on August 11, Judge Koetl found that the Commission has made a <i>prima facie</i> showing, and has demonstrated a sufficient basis to infer, that . . .

Scalping is the practice of recommending the purchase of a stock to the general public while selling the stock at or near the same time.  The Commissions complaint also alleges that the promoters touted Dicoms stock but did not disclose all of the compensation they were to receive pursuant to signed agreements., The Commissions complaint names the following defendants:,  David Gane, D.D.S., age 49, of White Rock, British Columbia, Canada.  Gane was Dicoms president, CEO, and a member of the board of directors.  Dicom was a provider of dental imaging software from 1999 to 2001 but has ceased operations.,  Jeffrey D.

Tamburello, age 30, of Weston, Florida.  Tamburello wrote investment opinions about Dicom.,  Capital Research Group, Inc. (CRG), a Florida investor relations firm run by Tamburello, which operates www.thesubway.com website.  CRG issued investment opinions about Dicom., The Commissions complaint alleges that Gane had Dicom hire the stock promoters in June and November 1999 to tout Dicoms stock in return for compensation.  Gane supplied the promoters with Dicoms financial projections for the next three years: $24.7 million in revenues and $19.7 million in earnings.  Two of the promoters, Welsh and Tamburello, each wrote investment opinions that described Dicom as an investment and set progressively higher targets for its stock price.  Welsh issued his investment opinions through SFS and SIG, while Tamburello issued his investment opinions through CRG.  In January 2000, Dicom announced that it was restating its financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 1999 from a gain to a loss.  Nevertheless, the stock promoters continued to repeat the projections in their investment opinions and set even higher targets for Dicoms stock price.  In addition, Gane, who had approved the announcement about the restatement, publicly announced even higher three-year revenue projections in January 2000, $50 million and $60 million, during interviews broadcast on television and over the Internet.  Dicoms stock price increased from $5.08 per share, when trading began in November 1999, to a high of $36 in March 2000., The Commissions complaint also alleges that the stock promoters failed to disclose all of the compensation they were to receive under the agreements signed with Dicom and that they engaged in scalping, resulting in their receipt of over $1.1 million in trading proceeds., The Commission seeks to enjoin Gane, Welsh, SFS, SIG, Tamburello, and CRG from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and to enjoin Welsh, SFS, SIG, Tamburello, and CRG from future violations of Sections 17(a) and 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933.

The Commission asserts that RJR has failed to comply with the Commissions subpoena., In its Application and supporting filings, the Commission alleges that, on June 24, 2003, it issued a Formal Order Directing Private Investigation and Designating Officers to Take Testimony (Formal Order).  The Formal Order authorizes the staff to conduct an investigation into whether RJR has violated, is violating or is about to violate various provisions of the federal securities laws.  The Commission asserts that the fees and expenses associated with RJRs defense of tobacco-related litigations - litigations which RJR, according to its publicly-disclosed policy, vigorously defends and does not settle - are relevant to its investigation., In its Application and supporting filings, the Commission alleges that, on July 3, 2003, the staff issued a subpoena to RJR, requiring RJR to produce (i) documents that quantify RJRs litigation fees and expenses on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis for each tobacco-related litigation; (ii) documents that concern the effect of such fees and expenses on various measures of RJRs financial condition; and (iii) documents that reflect the consideration given to RJRs disclosure of such information.  RJR produced a mere 6 documents in response to the subpoena, in addition to 5 documents it had produced earlier on a voluntary basis.  None of the documents produced contain quantitative fee and expense data.  None of the documents reflect the impact of such data on RJRs financial condition.  RJR informed the Commission that it is withholding additional responsive documents on grounds of the attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine.  RJR also informed the Commission that it believes its litigation fee and expense data is commercially sensitive and thus should not be produced absent the entry of a confidentiality agreement which would restrict the Commissions use of RJRs documents during its investigation, and subsequently, and would prohibit the Commission from coordinating its investigation with other law enforcement agencies.  The Commission postponed the deposition of RJRs Custodian of Records since RJR has not produced a significant number of documents responsive to the Commissions subpoena. , Pursuant to its Application, the Commission is seeking an Order directing RJR to show cause why it should not be ordered by this Court to produce documents and provide testimony pursuant to the Commissions subpoena and an Order requiring RJR to comply fully with the Commissions subpoena.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18288.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Cal.)</h2>, <h2>COMMISSION SUES BARRED BROKER FOR UNLAWFULLY ASSOCIATING WITH A BEVERLY HILLS BROKERAGE FIRM AND OTHERS FOR ASSISTING HIS VIOLATIONS</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a complaint in federal district court in Los Angeles against Raymond L. Kotrozo for violating an administrative order issued by the Commission in October 1990, and Pamela H. Wilson and Warner Pacific Financial, Inc. for aiding and abetting Kotrozos violations.  The Commission had previously barred Kotrozo, age 56, of Beverly Hills, California, from associating with any broker-dealer, with the right to reapply after five years.  Despite this bar order, the complaint alleges, Kotrozo associated with two Beverly Hills broker-dealers., In 1990, the Commission sued Kotrozo and his former brokerage firm, RL Kotrozo, Inc., for operating a Ponzi scheme, among other things.  Kotrozo was enjoined by a federal court in Arizona from committing future violations of the federal securities laws and ordered to pay over $1 million in ill-gotten gains.  The Commissions order barring Kotrozo from associating with a broker-dealer was based on that injunction., The complaint alleges that from January 1999 through September 2001, Kotrozo violated the 1990 bar order by associating with the Beverly Hills branch office of Grattan Financial Securities, Inc. (Grattan Branch Office), a registered broker-dealer, and Warner Pacific Financial, Inc., an unregistered broker-dealer.  The complaint alleges that Kotrozo associated with these entities by, among other things: (1) participating in the hiring, training and mentoring of brokers; (2) conducting investment seminars to obtain brokerage clients; (3) drafting and reviewing portfolio recommendations which were presented to prospective brokerage clients; and (4) participating in meetings with and making investment recommendations concerning specific mutual funds and variable annuity investments to prospective brokerage clients, some of who subsequently became actual clients.  During this time period, Kotrozo had not reapplied to be associated with a broker or dealer and received compensation of at least $400,000 derived from the Grattan Branch Offices securities-related business.  , The complaint further alleges that Wilson, age 43, of Burbank, California, and Warner Pacific, based in Beverly Hills, California, knowingly and substantially assisted Kotrozos unlawful association with both the Grattan Branch Office and Warner Pacific by: (1) attempting to conceal Kotrozos association with Grattan by characterizing Kotrozo as a Warner Pacific consultant who provided general economic advice and performed clerical tasks; (2) participating in meetings with prospective brokerage clients, including in meetings in which Kotrozo made investment recommendations; and (3) allowing Kotrozo to participate in Grattan Branch Office finances and compensating him for securities-related activities.  As a result of Kotrozos unlawful association, Wilson received over $400,000 in compensation.  The Complaint also alleges that Warner Pacific unlawfully acted as an unregistered broker-dealer in violation of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934., The complaint seeks injunctions, disgorgement and civil penalties against Kotrozo for violating the bar order and Section 15(b)(6)(B)(i) of the Exchange Act and against Wilson and Warner Pacific for aiding and abetting Kotrozos violations of Section 15(b)(6)(B)(i) of the Exchange Act.  The Complaint also alleges that Warner Pacific acted as an unregistered broker-dealer in violation of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18289.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18289.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

(July 23, 2003), <p align=CENTER><b>FINAL JUDGMENT ENTERED IN SECS FINANCIAL FRAUD CASE AGAINST PEREGRINE SYSTEMS, INC.</b>, The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on July 23, 2003, the United States District Court for the Southern District of California entered a final judgment in the Commissions civil action against San Diego-based software company Peregrine Systems, Inc.  , The final judgment-to which Peregrine consented without admitting or denying the complaints allegations-permanently enjoined Peregrine from violating certain antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws (Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5), and from violating certain reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions (Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B), and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13)., The final judgment also directed Peregrine to: (1) comply, on an accelerated basis, with the rules regarding managements report on internal controls, implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, (2) retain an Internal Auditor to ensure that Peregrines financial results are accurately reported in Peregrines public financial statements, (3) appoint a Corporate Compliance Officer to perform an ongoing review of Peregrines corporate governance policies and practices, (4) commence a training and education program for Peregrines officers and employees, to prevent violations of the federal securities laws,  and (5) disclose the current condition of Peregrines internal controls and financial reporting procedure, when a reorganization plan under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code became effective.  , The court also approved the Commissions decision not to require Peregrine to pay a civil money penalty or disgorgement in this action.  , The Commission filed its complaint against Peregrine on June 30, 2003, alleging  that Peregrine-through certain officers, employees, and certain others-committed a massive financial fraud that spanned 11 quarters (<a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18205a.htm>Litigation Release No. 18205A</a>).  According to the complaint, the purpose of the fraudulent scheme was to inflate the companys revenue and stock price.  To achieve that end, Peregrine filed materially incorrect financial statements with the Commission concerning the quarter ended June 30, 1999, through the quarter ended December 31, 2001.  In 2003 Peregrine restated its financial results for those quarters.  In its restatement, Peregrine reduced previously reported revenue of $1.34 billion by $509 million, of which at least $259 million was reversed because the underlying transactions lacked substance., Peregrine filed a voluntary petition to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on September 22, 2002, approximately four months after its accounting problems were made public.  Peregrines Plan of Reorganization became effective on August 7, 2003, and on that date Peregrine disclosed the current condition of its internal controls and financial reporting procedure in a Form 8-K filed with the Commission. , The Commissions case against Peregrine is the fourth civil action it has filed in this investigation.  In November 2002, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action against Ilse Cappel, the former senior treasury manager at Peregrine (<a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17859a.htm>Litigation Release No. 17859A</a>).

The U.S. Attorney will recommend the imposition of a 20-year prison sentence.  Sentencing is scheduled for October 31, 2003 in federal court in Seattle, Washington.  , As part of his plea, Lawrence waived any right to appeal, and agreed to cooperate fully with the U.S. Attorney and the receiver appointed as part of the Securities and Exchange Commissions related case in identifying assets. Additionally, Lawrence agreed to forfeit a number of previously-seized assets.  Originally indicted on July 31, 2002 in a 64-count indictment, Lawrence admitted that over the course of about 7 years he intentionally, knowingly, and willfully defrauded thousands of investors out of approximately $100 million through conspiracy and scheme to defraud involving false representations and failures to disclose accurate information in connection with the sale of the securities of Znetix, Inc., Health Maintenance Centers, Inc., Cascade Pointe, LLC, and affiliated entities.  He further admitted that he intentionally, knowingly, and willfully used the funds received from investors for his own personal use and benefit and for the use and benefit of his co-conspirators and others, including for the purchase of homes, cars, boats, merchandise, and travel. Finally, he admitted that he intentionally, knowingly, and willfully made false statements and directed others to make false statements to the State of Washingtons Department of Financial Institutions, Securities Division, and to the Securities and Exchange Commission., Previously, the Commission filed an emergency action on January 23, 2002, against Lawrence, as well as Znetix, Inc., Health Maintenance Centers, Inc., three related companies, their controlling executives, and several family members of Lawrence, alleging that Lawrence and other executives falsely promised investors lucrative profits from the supposedly imminent initial public offering of Znetix.  Additionally, the Commission alleged that Lawrence spent more than $14 million of investor funds on personal expenses, such as luxury cars, real estate, jewelry and boats.  On January 23, the Commission obtained an order freezing the assets of the defendants, and temporarily enjoining Lawrence and other controlling executives from future violations of the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  On February 15, 2002, the federal court preliminarily enjoined the defendants from such future violations and appointed a permanent receiver over the companies.  Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, the companies, on June 6, 2002, consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud and securities registration provisions.

Ohio) (August 18, 2003)</h2>, <h2>SEC Sues NCFE Executive for Role in $1 Billion Fraud</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, alleging that Sherry L. Gibson, an Executive Vice President at National Century Financial Enterprises, Inc. (NCFE), participated in a scheme to defraud investors in securities issued by subsidiaries of NCFE.  NCFE, a private corporation located in Dublin, Ohio, and its subsidiaries collapsed suddenly in October 2002 when investors discovered that the companies had hidden massive cash and collateral shortfalls from investors and auditors.  The collapse caused investor losses exceeding $1 billion.  Gibson, a resident of Hilliard, Ohio, consented to a permanent injunction prohibiting her from violating the federal securities laws; an order barring her from serving as an officer or director of a public company; and disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty, with those amounts to be determined at a later hearing., The complaint alleges that two wholly-owned subsidiaries of NCFE purchased medical accounts receivable from health-care providers and issued notes that securitized those receivables.  Between 1999 and 2002, the subsidiaries offered and sold at least $3.25 billion in total notes through private placements to institutional investors., The complaint further alleges that Gibson and other senior NCFE officials improperly advanced to health-care providers $1 billion or more of the capital raised from investors without receiving required medical accounts receivable in return.  These advances were essentially unauthorized, unsecured loans to distressed or defunct health-care providers-many of which were partly or wholly owned by NCFE or its principals.  The unsecured advances were inconsistent with representations made by Gibson and other senior NCFE officials in offering documents provided to investors., According to the complaint, Gibson and other senior NCFE officials concealed their fraud from trustees, investors, potential investors, and auditors by: (1) repeatedly transferring funds between the subsidiaries bank accounts to mask cash shortfalls of as much as $400 million; (2) recording $1 billion or more in non-existent or ineligible medical accounts receivable on the subsidiaries books; (3) creating and distributing false offering documents, false monthly investor reports, and false accounting records to trustees, investors, potential investors, and auditors; and (4) misrepresenting the status of the programs cash accounts and collateral base to trustees, investors, potential investors, and auditors., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Gibson consented to the entry of an order that: (1) permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder; (2) permanently bars her from serving as an officer or director of a public company; and (3) orders her to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil monetary penalty, with those amounts to be determined at a later hearing., The Commission filed its action at the same time that the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Ohio unsealed a criminal information against Gibson for the conduct that is the subject of the Commissions complaint.  The Commission thanks the United States Attorneys Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for their assistance in this investigation.  , The Commission is continuing its investigation in this matter as to other parties., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18292.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18292.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Rica Foods, with executive offices in Miami, Florida and its corporate headquarters in Costa Rica, and Chaves and Sequeira, who reside in Costa Rica, consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions Complaint, to the entry of a Final Judgment of Permanent Injunction and Other Relief (Final Judgment).   , According to the Commissions Complaint, on January 13, 2003, Rica Foods filed a Form 10-K annual report with the Commission containing a purported unqualified independent auditors report from Deloitte &amp; Touche (Deloitte).   The audit report represented that Rica Foods consolidated financial statements were presented fairly and in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.   At the time of the filing, however, Deloitte had not provided Rica Foods with a signed audit report, and Rica Foods financial statements contained material classification errors. , Despite the lack of a signed audit report and the existence of these material errors, Chaves and Sequeira, personally certified in the annual report that the Form 10-K filing fairly and accurately presented Rica Foods financial condition.   Chaves and Sequeira signed these certifications pursuant to Section 302 of Sarbanes-Oxley, which required the Commission to adopt rules requiring an issuers principal executive and financial officer each to certify the financial and other information contained in the issuers quarterly and annual reports.   , The Final Judgment will permanently enjoin Rica Foods from violating Sections 13(a),13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder, which governs the accuracy of issuer books and records and financial disclosures.

In April and May 1998, Christensen and others issued three press releases that contained false and misleading statements about the ownership, nature and value of certain mineral assets that Mountain Energy had purportedly acquired.  These releases caused the price of Mountain Energy stock to rise from 4¢ per share to a high of $1.75 per share on heavy volume trading.  Contemporaneously with the publication of the press releases, Christensen authorized the issuance of over 10 million shares of Mountain Energy stock to certain of his associates.  These individuals sold the shares in the open market and kicked back $896,000 in trading profits to Christensen.

Previously, in a South Carolina criminal proceeding, both were ordered to disgorge commissions received from their participation in a nationwide ponzi scheme that raised over $13.5 million from 140 mostly elderly Texas investors.  The Commission decided not to seek a civil penalty against Westshore Agency based on its sworn financial statements and other information provided to the Commission or against Hicks because of his bankruptcy proceedings under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code., In its civil action, the Commission alleged that Hicks and Westshore Agency organized a group of insurance agents in Texas who sold promissory notes issued by Chemical Trust, a purported business trust, as part of a nationwide ponzi scheme.  The promissory notes were claimed to be secured by surety bonds issued by United States Guarantee Corporation, an Arizona based surety company.  In reality, the control persons behind Chemical Trust were diverting investor funds to their own use and the surety company was being run by a convicted felon and held no assets with which to secure the promissory notes.  The Commission alleged that the defendants were in a position to learn of the issuers fraudulent scheme, but failed to conduct any meaningful due diligence before selling the securities to their insurance clients., The defendants consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining each from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Sanpietro; Chief Financial Officer, Laurence M. Simon; and Vice President of Sales, Lawrence P. Marasco.  These three corporate officials also pleaded guilty today to related criminal charges, including lying during the SEC investigation. The civil and the criminal cases were both filed before the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.   , The SECs complaint alleges that Sanpietro, Simon and Marasco inflated Medi-Huts revenues and earnings through fictitious period-end invoices and other accounting irregularities.  According to the complaint, Sanpietro and Simon also concealed from the investing public the fact that Marasco secretly owned and controlled one of Medi-Huts largest customers, and that all three defendants lied to Medi-Huts independent auditors.  These fraudulent accounting and disclosure devices and the lies to Medi-Huts auditors enabled the company to tout blockbuster revenue growth and created the appearance of profitability, when in fact the company was operating at a loss.  As a result, Medi-Huts Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2001, and three Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-Q for fiscal year ended October 31, 2002, were materially false and misleading.  The complaint further alleged that the market for Medi-Hut common stock responded to this misinformation, remaining at an artificially high level.  The stock traded between approximately $7 and $13 in January 2002.  After Medi-Huts fraud was partially disclosed to the market through news articles and press releases, the stock price began to spiral downward.  According to the complaint, Sanpietro was unjustly enriched by his sale of Medi-Hut common stock during the relevant period. , Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Medi-Hut consented to a final judgment permanently enjoining it from violating Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13, promulgated thereunder.

The Commission alleged that Thomas, a United States postal employee in Mount Vernon in the late 1990s, illicitly obtained the information from the magazine, which he intercepted from the U.S. Mail on its way to subscribers and news stands, in violation of postal regulations.  Thomas shared information from the Inside Wall Street column with a friend and traded in his own accounts.  Thomass trading in stocks mentioned in a year-and-a-half period enabled him to reap profits of $154,268.61.  Thomass friend, Lionel Thotam, who settled with the Commission in October 2002 for insider trading, profited by $77,213.38 from inside information Thomas provided him. , The Complaint charges Thomas with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5.  The Commissions Complaint seeks a permanent injunction against Thomas from future violations of the antifraud provisions, disgorgement of illicit gains, and other appropriate relief.  The Complaint, along with the indictment in the parallel criminal proceeding, was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York., The Commissions Complaint alleges as follows:, From August 1996 through January 1999, Thomas misappropriated information from <i>Business Week</i> magazine before its public release by reading the Inside Wall Street column in the magazine as it passed through the Mount Vernon, New York postal sorting facility on its way to subscribers and news stands.  He tipped Thotam to the information.  Thotam paid Thomas $10,000 for Thomass efforts, and updated Thomas on his profits from the illegal trades.  Starting in June 1997 and continuing through January 1999, Thomas also traded in his own accounts in the stocks of the companies mentioned in the Inside Wall Street column.  In almost all instances, Thotam and Thomas bought stock of companies favorably mentioned in the column on Thursday afternoons and sold the stock after the price increased the next day, after the column had been published.  Thomass profits amounted to $154,268.61.  By tipping Thotam to material, nonpublic information in breach of confidentiality requirements of postal regulations, and by trading on such information himself, Thomas violated the antifraud provisions of the Exchange Act. , The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the American Stock Exchange and the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York.   , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18298.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18298.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

This action is the first Commission enforcement proceeding involving an investment company Sarbanes-Oxley certification.  Simultaneously, the Office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York announced Davids indictment on criminal charges arising from the alleged embezzlement., The Commissions Complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that David, formerly an employee of Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., f/k/a Salomon Smith Barney, Inc., (Citigroup Global Markets), stole funds from two affiliated registered investment companies: Consulting Group Capital Markets Funds (the Consulting Group Fund), and Smith Barney World Funds Inc. (the Smith Barney World Fund) (collectively, the Funds).  In addition, at the very time that he was embezzling from the Funds, David signed a certification pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in which he falsely stated that he had disclosed to the Consulting Group Funds auditors and audit committee any fraud, whether material or not, involving management, when in fact he had made no such disclosure., The Complaint alleges as follows:,  At the time of the misconduct, David was the treasurer and chief financial officer of the Consulting Group Fund and controller of the Smith Barney World Fund, two registered investment companies.  From January 2001 through January 2003, David engaged in two schemes to embezzle money from the Funds.  In one scheme, David embezzled funds paid to the Consulting Group Fund in connection with the settlement of class action lawsuits or other corporate actions in which the Consulting Group Fund was a participant and was entitled to receive a payment. In the second scheme, David redeemed shares out of an error account that had been established for the Smith Barney World Fund at its transfer agent and embezzled the proceeds.  As a result of these two schemes, David embezzled a total of approximately $47,529 from the Funds, of which $14,529 has not been repaid.,  Rule 30a-2 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and the Investment Company Act of 1940 (Investment Company Act), pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, required that David, as treasurer and chief financial officer of the Consulting Group Fund, certify that he had disclosed to the Funds auditors and audit committee any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the investment companys internal controls[.],  On October 28, 2002, David signed the Rule 30a-2 certification of Consulting Group Funds Form N-SAR for the six months ended August 31, 2002, certifying that he had made the required disclosure of any management fraud, when in fact he had embezzled approximately $10,703 from the Consulting Group Fund during the reporting period and had not disclosed this fraud.  This false certification was filed with the Commission along with the Consulting Group Funds Form N-SAR. Form N-SAR is a filing that is required under both the Investment Company Act and the Exchange Act.,  David, age 42, is a resident of Staten Island, New York.  David was fired by Citigroup Global Markets in January 2003, shortly after his embezzlement was discovered., The Complaint charges David with violating Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act and Sections 34(b) and 37 of the Investment Company Act, and with breach of fiduciary duty within the meaning of Section 36(a) the Investment Company Act.

The Court simultaneously entered a preliminary injunction freezing Gray and Metropoliss financial assets for the duration of the case, including approximately $1.4 million held in ten accounts identified by the Commission.  Gray is currently in custody in a related criminal prosecution brought by the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of California., The Commission filed a complaint against Gray and Metropolis on May 1, 2003, alleging that the defendants raised $5.1 million by selling interests in a non-existent Asset Management Program from July to November 2002.  Gray lured investors by offering high returns on their investment and promising that investors funds would be protected by insurance.  Instead of investing the money and purchasing insurance, however, Gray dissipated approximately $2 million on personal items, including a new car and jewelry, and on expenditures for unrelated business projects.  Account statements indicate that Gray also withdrew hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, which to date the Commission has not been able to trace.  Immediately upon the filing of the complaint, the Court ordered the defendants to account for all of the investors funds.  When Gray and Metropolis failed to comply, the Court entered the July 14 order to show cause why they should not be held in contempt.  , Gray and Metropolis have not responded to the complaint.  As a result, the Commission has filed a motion for a default judgment, which is currently scheduled to be heard by the Court on September 8, 2003.  In the motion, the Commission has asked the Court to find that Gray and Metropolis violated the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission has further requested that the Court order defendants to return the proceeds of their fraud to the investors and pay civil penalties, and enter permanent injunctions prohibiting them from committing future violations of the securities laws.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18301.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Coyle (Coyle), who, according to the Commissions complaint, made false and misleading statements to investors about an offering of securities and caused a private placement memorandum containing false and misleading statements to be sent to investors.  The court permanently enjoined Coyle from future violations of the antifraud and registration provisions of the securities laws, ordered Coyle to disgorge ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposed a civil penalty of $25,000.  Pursuant to Section 308 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the court ordered that the civil penalty be paid to the court registry for the benefit of investors.  Coyle consented to the entry of the judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint., In its complaint, the Commission charged Coyle, along with Michael Nnebe (Nnebe), Nelson Walker (Walker), Hildreth Fleming, Jr. (Fleming), and Steven Bocchino (Bocchino), with participating in a fraudulent offering of Fargo Holdings, Inc. (Fargo), a company owned and controlled by Nnebe.  Through this scheme, the defendants raised approximately $2 million from at least 118 investors, the majority of which was stolen by Nnebe.  Coyle, a registered representative, solicited investors and received $7,000 from the offering proceeds., According to the complaint, Coyle solicited investors to purchase Fargo stock by falsely stating that Fargo would be conducting an IPO in the near future and that the IPO would allow investors to resell their Fargo stock for a substantial profit.  Coyle based these statements on information provided by Nnebe without doing any further inquiry about Fargo or the likelihood of a Fargo IPO.  In addition, Coyle falsely told investors that purchasing Fargo stock was risk free because investor funds would be returned if Fargo did not conduct an IPO, and caused the Fargo private placement memorandum containing false statements about Fargos purported business operations to be sent to investors.  Coyle knew, or recklessly disregarded, that his statements to investors about the risk of investing in Fargo stock and the statements about Fargos business operations in the offering documents were false because Coyle knew that Fargo had no business operations.  Coyle also distributed a private placement memorandum to investors that misrepresented, among other things, the anticipated uses of investor proceeds and the levels of commissions paid for selling Fargo stock and falsely stated that Fargo operated various businesses, including a day-trading and import-export business.  Coyle knew, or recklessly disregarded, that statements contained in the private placement memorandum were false., The court permanently enjoined Coyle from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(a), 77e(c), and 77q(a), and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5.

The SEC charged Lapin and Wigginton with fraud and securities registration violations, based on their sales of interests in limited partnerships that were set up to fund commercial mortgages; and also with violations of investment adviser reporting requirements.  Lapin and Wigginton have both agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of orders that: enjoin them from further violations of the securities laws; hold them liable for disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties; and bar them from association with a broker-dealer or investment adviser.   LWAM ceased operations late in 2001, around the time that its corporate parent, Premiere Holdings of Texas, LP, filed for bankruptcy protection.

The SEC alleges that Lapin &amp; Wigginton knowingly or recklessly misled investors about risk-related facts such as:  the inferior lien positions that some limited partnerships held as security for their invested principal; delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures on mortgage loans in which some of the limited partnerships had invested; and the rate of the origination fees (usually 25%) that the commercial borrowers were paying in connection with the loans.  The SEC alleges that Lapin and Wigginton thereby violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and aided and abetted LWAMs violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act).  , The SEC also alleges that Lapin and Wigginton violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act, by offering and selling securities when no registration statement for the offering either was effective or had been filed., Finally, the SEC alleges that Lapin and Wigginton violated Sections 206(4) and 207 of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-4(a) thereunder, by failing to disclose fully and accurately, in reports that LWAM filed with the SEC, a disciplinary action that the New York Stock Exchange instituted against Lapin in 1999 for conduct unrelated to the limited partnership investments., Simultaneously with the filing of its action, the Commission accepted offers of settlement from Lapin and Wigginton, in which each of them agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions Complaint, to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from further violating the securities laws cited above, and sets the amounts of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties for which they are liable as follows:  for Lapin, disgorgement of  $3,235,990 in illicit profits, $282,075 in prejudgment interest, and a civil money penalty of $120,000; and for Wigginton, disgorgement of  $647,198 in illicit profits, $56,415 in prejudgment interest, and a civil money penalty of $120,000.

Ehrman, former CEO of Rocky Mountain Energy Corporation.  The Securities and Exchange Commission had filed a civil action against Rocky Mountain, Ehrman, and Rocky Mountains General Counsel, W. Roderick Johnson, on April 3, 2003, in connection with an illegal unregistered offering of Rocky Mountain securities and a fraudulent manipulation of the companys stock.  The lawsuit was filed to halt an alleged fraudulent pump-and-dump scheme involving the securities of Rocky Mountain, a Houston-based oil-and-gas company whose stock is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board.  , The SEC complaint alleges that, from July 2002 to the present, Ehrman used four bogus share-exchange transactions to secretly obtain control of approximately 50% of Rocky Mountains issued and outstanding stock.  Additionally, it is alleged that Rocky Mountain and Ehrman issued a stream of glowing but false and misleading press releases to artificially inflate the price and trading volume of the companys stock.  The press releases and other promotional statements, touted numerous acquisitions of valuable oil-and-gas properties, or agreements to acquire such properties, along with expected revenues and other benefits from the acquisitions.  The complaint alleges that Rocky Mountain had neither the assets nor the financing to complete these acquisitions.  Concurrent with the misleading public announcements, it is alleged that Ehrman and Johnson dumped more than $800,000 of Rocky Mountain stock into the unsuspecting marketplace., In carrying out the fraudulent scheme, Ehrman allegedly caused Rocky Mountain to file false and misleading reports and registration statements with the SEC.  Among other things, these filings failed to disclose that Ehrman caused Rocky Mountain to issue approximately 47 million shares of stock in four sham share-exchange transactions.  The filings also misrepresented Ehrmans ownership, transfer, and sale of approximately 31 million of these shares.  , Ehrman was previously enjoined by the Commission in another fraudulent oil and gas scheme in 1990 (<i>SEC v.

The final judgment has yet to be entered.   , Of the six other defendants named in this action, five--including Solucorp, other former officers and/or directors, Arle Pierro, James G. Spartz, and W. Bryan Fair, and the companys former outside auditor, Glenn R. Ohlhauser--entered into settlements with the Commission prior to the commencement of the six-day trial pursuant to which they consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws. , The Commissions Complaint, filed on December 13, 1999, as amended, alleged that, over a four year period, from mid-1995 through early 1999, Solucorps senior management, including Kemprowski, who acted as the <i>de facto</i> head of Solucorp, claimed in press releases and other publicly disseminated materials to have contracts that either did not exist or were subject to undisclosed material contingencies, or that provided for revenues materially below those announced by the company.  The Complaint also alleged that senior management falsified Solucorps financial statements by improperly recognizing as revenue license fees that were subject to material contingencies.  Solucorps improper recognition of license fees resulted in its filing with the Commission periodic, transition and interim reports, including financial statements, on at least five occasions from December 1997 through April 1999, which materially overstated revenue.   <i>See</i> Lit. Rel. No. 16388 (Dec. 13, 1999). , In its July 25, 2003 opinion and order, the Court found that, [o]ver a number of years, Solucorp and its executives engaged in a course of deception through the issuance of false and misleading press releases and financial statements in which, in a number of cases, they reported that the Company had entered into contracts that did not exist, in one case backdated a contract to increase the accrued revenue recognizable thereunder, and in many other cases reported that the minimum revenues to be derived from such contracts far exceeded the actual minimums.  The Court found that this pattern of deception was so consistent and pervasive that it cannot logically be attributed to mere negligence.  Accordingly, the executives responsible for the issuance of these press releases and financial statements, specifically Kemprowski, Mantia and Herman, knowingly and deliberately falsified them with the intention of deceiving shareholders and potential investors or, at the very least, were guilty of reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of the disclosures., The Court found that Kemprowski, Mantia and Herman had violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and that Mantia and Herman had knowingly falsified the companys books, records and/or accounts, or were reckless in preparing or certifying them, and circumvented or failed to implement internal controls in violation of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-1, and Mantia misinformed the companys outside auditors in violation of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2.  The Court also found that Kemprowski and Mantia failed to disclose their equity ownership in Solucorp as of February 20, 1998, the effective date of Solucorps registration of its stock with the Commission, and to timely disclose changes in that ownership, in violation of Exchange Act Section 16(a).   , Each of the five defendants who settled the Commissions action prior to the commencement of the trial in March 2003 consented, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, to the entry of a final judgment providing for the full injunctive relief sought by the Commission.  On March 12, 2003, the Court signed the final judgments against Solucorp, James G. Spartz, a former vice president and a director of Solucorp, Arle Pierro, a former senior vice president and director of Solucorp, and W. Bryan Fair, a former director of Solucorp.  The final judgment against Solucorp permanently enjoined the company from violating the antifraud provisions of Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 and Securities Act Section 17(a), the reporting requirements of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-10 and 13a-13 thereunder, and the books and records and internal controls provisions of Exchange Act Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B).  The final judgment against Spartz permanently enjoined him from violating the antifraud provisions of Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the insider reporting requirements of Exchange Act Section 16(a) and Rules 16a-2 and 16a-3, but did not impose a civil penalty based on Spartzs sworn representations concerning his financial inability to pay.  The final judgments against Pierro and Fair permanently enjoined them from violating the disclosure rules for insiders, Exchange Act Section 16(a) and Rules 16a-2 and 16a-3 thereunder, and imposed a $10,000 civil penalty on Pierro for allegedly failing to timely disclose her equity ownership in Solucorp and changes in that ownership.  , On January 16, 2003, the Court entered a final judgment against another settling defendant, the companys former outside auditor, Glenn R. Ohlhauser, that permanently enjoined Ohlhauser from future violations of Exchange Act Section 10A.  <i>See </i><a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr16785.htm>Lit.

Judge Shadur found that Kirch owed ShowCases Chief Executive Officer and the other Executive Roundtable members an express duty to keep confidential all of the business information that Kirch learned at the October 1, 1999 Roundtable meeting.  Judge Shadur held that a duty of loyalty and confidentiality was created by policy and expectations that were present in the Software Executive Roundtable relationships.  Judge Shadur stated that Kirchs actions in trading on the nonpublic information, in violation of this duty, were obviously motivated by greed.  Judge Shadur held, therefore, that Kirch violated the securities laws by his improper sale of 8,500 shares of ShowCase on October 1, 1999.  , On August 22, 2003, Judge Shadur entered Final Judgment in this case.

The bonds were intended to finance the building of certain public purpose portions of a private office-building complex.  However, according to documents filed in court, the developer and others lied to investors about how bond proceeds would be used to acquire land for the project; falsely claimed that a prominent investment bank was involved in providing additional private financing for the project; falsely claimed that the project was already fully leased to a Triple A credit-rated company; and failed to disclose kickbacks to several of the offering participants., Currently, the bonds are in default and no substantial work has taken place on the project.

In fact, the developer used $6.2 million in bond proceeds to acquire a total of 39.9 acres, which included land for both the public and private purpose portions of the project., <i>Involvement of Prominent Investment Bank</i>:  The Official Statement represented that an entity called Goldman/Sig LLC had agreed to be a participating mortgage lender for the project.  According to the Official Statement, Goldman/Sig LLC was formed by Goldman Sachs, Private Client Services, along with Signal Mortgage.  This claim was false.  Goldman Sachs, Private Client Services had no involvement with the bonds or the project, and did not participate in the formation of Goldman/Sig LLC., <i>Existence of Construction Financing for Project</i>:  The Official Statement represented that the developer had entered into an agreement with Goldman/Sig to fund infrastructure construction and office building construction through completion and provide long-term mortgage financing.  This statement was false and misleading because Goldman/Sig had no ability to provide the nearly $65 million in financing required to complete the project., <i>Value of, and Existence of Lease Agreement for, the Project</i>:  According to an appraisal contained in the Official Statement, at the time the bonds were sold the developer had entered into a lease agreement covering the entire property with a single, unidentified tenant with a Triple A (corporate) credit rating.  Based on this information, the appraisal concluded that the project when built would have a value of $90 million.  This claim was false and misleading.  In fact, the developer had entered into an agreement with a small firm with a total of six employees and annual revenues of approximately $600,000, and no capacity to meet the projected monthly lease payments for the six buildings to be constructed in the project.  Moreover, the Official Statement failed to disclose that the developer had entered into a side agreement that allowed the lessee to cancel the lease at any time., <i>Undisclosed Payments to Offering Participants</i>:  The Official Statement disclosed that bond proceeds would be used to pay $100,000 to attorney Tulls law firm and $140,000 to attorney McCalls law firm for their work in providing legal opinions on the bond offering.  However, the Official Statement failed to disclose that on the day the bond offering closed, the developer used bond proceeds to make additional payments of $60,000 to Tull and $45,000 to McCall. The Official Statement also failed to disclose that shortly after closing the developer used bond proceeds to make a $200,000 payment to underwriter Ibis and a $50,000 payment to Tezak, who was purportedly involved in obtaining private financing for the project., The Commissions complaint charges Terry Martin and two of his corporate entities (Silver Legacy Corporation and Silver Sound LLC), as well as Smith, McCall, Tull, Kenneth Martin and Tamura with fraud in the offer and sale of securities, in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exhange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., In addition, the complaint charges that Tezak, White, Signal Mortgage and Goldman/Sig violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and violated or aided and abetted violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., Finally, the complaint charges that Ibis violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board Rule G-17, and Sections 10(b) and 15B(c)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission seeks permanent injunctions prohibiting future violations against each defendant, as well as the return of all monies received as a result of the fraud plus pre-judgment interest, and civil money penalties., In a separate action, the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Washington also announced the filing of criminal charges against Terry Martin, Smith, White and Tezak for their roles in the bond offering. , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18315.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18315.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Utah, Case no. 2:97 CV 0425)</b>, <b>WENGER CONVICTED OF TOUTING STOCK ON RADIO WITHOUT DISCLOSING COMPENSATION RECEIVED FROM UTAH COMPANY</b>, On August 26, 2003, a federal jury convicted Jerome M. Wenger on criminal charges for failing to disclose in 1994 that he had been paid 2.1 million shares of PanWorld Minerals International stock (PWLM) to recommend on his nationally-syndicated radio shows and newsletters titled The Next SuperStock that investors buy PanWorlds stock.  The jury in the United States District Court for the Central District of Utah also found that Wenger failed to disclose that he was recommending investors should buy at the same time he was selling PanWorld stock that he owned.  Wenger was convicted of two counts of violating Section 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933, the provision that requires persons publishing information about stocks to disclose if they have received compensation from a public company to make the recommendation and the amount of compensation, and one count of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, which prohibit persons from making false statements or omitting material facts in connection with the sale of securities.  Sentencing in this matter is set for November 17, 2003., During 1994 and continuing into 1997, Wenger, who was based in Bethesda, Maryland, recommended penny stocks and other low-price securities on his radio shows that were broadcast weekly in Washington D.C., New York, Miami, Phoenix, Chicago, Seattle and other locations.  He also published bi-monthly newsletters to investors recommending his stock picks.  Although he often disclosed he was a paid consultant, Wenger failed to disclose, in both the radio shows and the newsletters that discussed PanWorld, the amount of compensation that he had received to include the company in his recommendations.  During 1994, Wenger sold over $100,000 of PanWorld stock at the same time he was telling investors to purchase it without disclosing his sales.  PanWorld Minerals International, a now-defunct mining company, had offices located in Salt Lake City, Utah., The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action against Wenger in June 1997 in the United States District Court for Utah, and alleged that Wenger violated the securities registration, touting, and anti-fraud provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c), 17(a) and (b) of the Securities Act, and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5.

PETER J. DAVIS, JR., JOHN M. YOUNGDAHL and STEVEN E. NOTHERN</i> (United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Civil Action No. 03-CV6672(NRB)), The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) today announced three related enforcement actions arising from trading in U.S. Treasury 30-year bonds minutes before the Treasury Department announced, on October 31, 2001, that it would no longer issue such bonds. The Treasury Departments announcement had a dramatic market impact, causing the largest one-day price movement in the 30-year bond since October 1987.  Goldman Sachs &amp; Company (Goldman Sachs), Massachusetts Financial Services Company (MFS), and Peter J. Davis, Jr., the individual who misappropriated the Treasury Department information that was subject to a news embargo, will pay a total of over $10.3 million to settle the Commissions actions.    , In a civil suit in federal court in New York, the Commission filed securities fraud charges against:, , , , Davis has entered into a settlement with the Commission.  Youngdahl and Nothern are contesting the charges., Based on its former employee Youngdahls conduct and on the bond trading that occurred as a result, Goldman Sachs has consented to a Commission administrative order finding that the firm violated the anti-fraud laws applicable to broker-dealers and government securities broker-dealers.  The Commissions order also finds that Goldman Sachs lacked adequate safeguards to prevent the misuse of material nonpublic information obtained from paid consultants.  Goldman Sachs will pay over $9.3 million in disgorgement of trading profits, interest, and penalties.  The order also recognizes that Goldman Sachs promptly notified the Commission staff about the trading that occurred and cooperated with the Commissions investigation., MFS has consented to a Commission administrative order finding that the firm lacked adequate safeguards to prevent the misuse of material nonpublic information obtained from paid consultants.  MFS will pay a penalty of $200,000 and will reimburse another firm for over $700,000 in trading losses incurred by selling to MFS the bonds that Nothern and the other fund managers purchased.  The Commissions order also recognizes that MFS promptly notified the Commission staff about the trading that occurred and cooperated with the Commissions investigation., The Commissions complaint against Davis, Youngdahl and Nothern alleges that Davis marketed himself to Wall Street clients by claiming special access that enabled him to get Washington information ahead of the media, and by promising clients the first call on investment issues they care about.  MFS retained Davis as a consultant sometime between 1995-1997, and Goldman Sachs retained Davis beginning in the spring of 2001.  Youngdahl, who advised Treasury Desk traders on economic and political developments, was Davis primary contact at Goldman Sachs.  Nothern, who managed seven fixed income mutual funds for MFS, was Davis primary contact at MFS., The complaint alleges that, since 1994, Davis had attended the Treasury Departments quarterly refunding press conferences under an explicit agreement that he would honor the news embargo that Treasury imposed until the designated public announcement time.  At these press conferences, the Treasury Department announced the Federal Governments financing requirements for the coming quarter.  Notwithstanding his agreement to abide by the news embargo, the complaint alleges that, in July 2001, Davis and Youngdahl agreed in a series of e-mails that Davis would provide Youngdahl with confidential information from the Treasury Departments quarterly refunding press conferences prior to the expiration of the embargo.  Davis had previously conveyed confidential refunding information to Youngdahl in May 2001, and, pursuant to their July agreement, did so again in August 2001., The complaint further alleges that, at the October 31, 2001, refunding press conference, Treasury Department officials announced three times that the information being made available was embargoed until 10:00 a.m.  The press conference ended at approximately 9:25 a.m.  Then, Davis, despite the officials warnings, and in violation of his prior explicit agreement to abide by the embargo, placed a series of cell phone calls to his clients, including Youngdahl and Nothern, beginning at 9:28 a.m., and told them that the Treasury Department was suspending future long bond issuances.  The complaint alleges that Youngdahl knew that Davis, pursuant to their July agreement, was tipping him with confidential Treasury Department information before the information was released to the public.  The complaint also alleges that Nothern knew, from a voice mail which Davis left him and which he listened to, that Davis had learned about the suspension of 30-year bond issuances directly from the Treasury Department, and that the news was embargoed until a scheduled 10:00 a.m. press announcement. , The Commissions complaint charges Davis, Youngdahl, and Nothern with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks injunctions, disgorgement, and civil money penalties.  Prior to the filing of the action, Davis consented, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, to the entry of a permanent injunction from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and a court order that he disgorge $29,598, which represents the amount of consulting fees he received from Goldman Sachs and MFS plus prejudgment interest, and pay a penalty of $120,000., The Commissions administrative order against Goldman Sachs finds that, because of Youngdahls conduct and the trading that ensued, Goldman Sachs willfully violated Sections 15(c)(1)(A) and 15(c)(1(C) of the Exchange Act and Rule 15c1-2 thereunder, the provisions that prohibit fraud by broker-dealers and government securities dealers.  The order also finds that Goldman Sachs willfully violated Section 15(f) of the Exchange Act because it did not have written policies and procedures reasonably designed, taking into consideration the nature of the firms business, to prevent the misuse of material nonpublic information.  During the relevant period, Goldman Sachs, and the Treasury Desk in particular, employed numerous paid consultants who provided a wide range of information and analysis.  Although Goldman Sachs did have written policies on the proper handling and use of material, confidential information, these policies did not expressly address the use of such consultants or the handling of information obtained from them., Goldman Sachs consented to the Commissions order without admitting or denying the Commissions findings.  The order censures Goldman Sachs, orders the firm to cease and desist from committing or causing future violations, and orders Goldman Sachs to disgorge $1,742,642 in bond trading profits and prejudgment interest, and to pay a penalty of $5,000,000.  In addition Goldman Sachs is undertaking to disgorge $2,562,740 in bond futures trading profits and prejudgment interest.  The Commissions order also requires Goldman Sachs Legal Department to do a review of the firms policies and procedures and to implement corrective measures to prevent any possible future abuse of material nonpublic information with respect to the use of consultants.  , The Commissions Order against MFS finds that MFS willfully violated Section 204A of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 because it lacked adequate safeguards to prevent the misuse of material nonpublic information with respect to information obtained from consultants.  Although MFS retained numerous paid consultants like Peter Davis, the firms written materials on the use of nonpublic information only referenced inside information received from company insiders or their agents, and did not discuss the potential that paid consultants might provide such information.  Without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, MFS consented to the entry of the Commissions order, which censures MFS, requires MFS to cease and desist from committing or causing future violations, and orders MFS to pay a penalty of $200,000.  The order also requires MFS General Counsels office to do a review of the firms policies and procedures and to implement corrective measures to prevent any possible future abuse of material nonpublic information with respect to the use of consultants.  In addition, MFS is undertaking to reimburse the broker-dealer that sold MFS the 30-year bonds $717,858, representing losses by the broker-dealer from selling 30-year bonds to MFS on October 31, 2001, and prejudgment interest on that amount., The Commission has investigated this matter -- which remains open-- in coordination with, and acknowledges the cooperation and assistance of, the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York, which has entered into a plea agreement with Peter Davis and obtained the indictment of John Youngdahl.  The Commission also acknowledges the cooperation and assistance of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the United States Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the United States Postal Inspection Service throughout this investigation., , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18322.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18322.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Slatkin was sentenced yesterday by United States District Judge Margaret M. Morrow to 14 years in prison after pleading guilty last year to a series of criminal charges related to a massive Ponzi scheme, including conspiracy to obstruct justice during an SEC enforcement investigation.  In March 2002, Slatkin pleaded guilty to 15 felony charges, including mail and wire fraud, money laundering and conspiracy to obstruct justice, for fraudulently soliciting nearly $600 million from approximately 800 investors during a 15-year period.  , In his plea agreement, Slatkin admitted that, in order to obstruct the SECs investigation and to conceal the fact that his investment program was a massive Ponzi scheme, he and other co-conspirators provided to the SEC false documents, including fabricated correspondence and account statements, and he lied to the SEC under oath about the success of his investments, the accuracy of account statements, and his intention not to accept additional investor funds., On May 11, 2001, the SEC obtained a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against Slatkin, a co-founder, former director and substantial shareholder of Earthlink, Inc., in federal district court in Los Angeles.  The Commission alleged that Slatkin defrauded hundreds of clients through his unregistered investment advisory business located in Santa Barbara, California.   , On June 7, 2001, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a Judgment of Permanent Injunction against Reed E. Slatkin.

The complaint alleges that from approximately July through October 2001, the defendants raised approximately $541,000 from investors in a fraudulent, unregistered offering of securities.  At the time of the conduct alleged in the complaint, Mohamad Elzein and Hussein El Zein were residents of Columbia, South Carolina.  Knee is a resident of Winter Park, Florida., The Commissions complaint alleges that the defendants offered and sold securities to investors in the form of investment contracts.  According to the complaint, no registration statement was filed with the Commission in connection with the offers and sales, and no exemption from registration exists.  The complaint alleges that the offering documents used, variously, all of the following names in describing the entity that was sponsoring the investment:  Focus Mentors Elzein Management, FMEM and FMEM International, Inc. (collectively referred to as Focus Mentors), as well as FEME Focus Enterprises, Inc.  The latter is a Georgia corporation solely owned by another individual, and the corporate name was used without the knowledge or consent of the owner.  , According to the complaint, the defendants made materially false and misleading statements and omissions in connection with the offers and sales of the investment contracts including, among other things, false historical returns, and promised returns without a reasonable basis therefor. Also, according to the complaint, the private placement memorandum utilized by the defendants inaccurately stated that Focus Mentors was fully insured by Allstate Insurance Company, such that the assets of Focus Mentors were protected in the unlikely case that Focus Mentors or its executives were to declare bankruptcy.  The complaint further alleges that the private placement memorandum falsely stated that each clients principal investment was protected in the case of acts of dishonesty.  These statements were false because Focus Mentors did not have such insurance., The complaint also alleges that Knee promoted Focus Mentors on his MoneyJoe.com website and in his related electronic newsletter called Insiders Club.  Among other things, the complaint alleges that Knees website described Focus Mentors as a secure opportunity with 107% <i>plus</i> principal guaranteed even though Knee had no reasonable basis for such statements.  The complaint also alleges that in some of newsletters, Knee referred to investments in Focus Mentors as a zero risk opportunity.  In other newsletters, according to the complaint, Knee falsely stated that Focus Mentors investors were guaranteed the same security that they could find at a bank., The complaint alleges that by their conduct, the defendants violated Sections 5(a),  5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission seeks, with respect to each defendant, permanent injunctions, accountings, disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18324.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18324.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Civil Action No. 3:98-CV2792-G [USDC/NDTX/Dallas Division]</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that Gardere Wynne Sewell LLP, a Dallas-based law firm, has agreed to pay $2 million for alleged violations of a federal court order issued by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas in an SEC enforcement action., The settlement arises from a civil enforcement action against Sharp Capital, Inc. and Mauricio Gutierrez, both of which are former clients of Gardere.  During the course of the SEC litigation, Gardere failed to produce to a court-appointed Special Master, Ralph S. Janvey, approximately 42,000 pages of Sharps records that Gardere maintained in its possession; concealed the existence of approximately $148,000, which was derived from Sharps operations and held in a Gardere client trust account for the benefit of Gutierrez; and failed to disclose the existence of an offshore bank account controlled by Gutierrez and which held approximately $450,000 that was derived from Sharps operations., The SEC and Special Master contend that Garderes conduct violated the court order appointing Mr. Janvey as Special Master.  Pursuant to the order, Gardere was required to deliver to the Special Master all of Sharps business records and restrained Gardere from concealing any of Sharps assets., In addition to the payment of $2 million, which includes the reimbursement of attorneys fees for the Special Master, Judge Barbara Lynn ordered Gardere to institute a formal, firm-wide policy and procedure regarding future document productions to insure that these types of professional lapses do not recur.    , Sharp is a former registered investment adviser that catered to Mexican and other Latin American investors.  The SEC lawsuit against Sharp alleged that the company and Gutierrez lost as much as $80 million of client funds in highly leveraged investments in speculative securities of Eastern European and South American companies without client knowledge or authorization.   , In November 1998, the SEC obtained emergency orders from the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas freezing Sharps assets and appointing a Special Master to collect and maintain the assets of Sharp for the benefit of its advisory clients.  Among other things, the orders directed Sharp, Gutierrez, and their agents immediately to provide to the Special Master all non-privileged books, records and documents relating to Sharps activities and to preserve all of Sharps assets pending the outcome of the civil litigation., As their attorney, Gardere negotiated the terms and language of the orders on behalf of Sharp and Gutierrez.  Gardere, however, failed to turn over to the Special Master 27 boxes of Sharps records until 18 months after the entry of the orders.  The boxes contained relevant documents not previously produced to the Special Master.  Gardere also failed to disclose to the Special Master and the SEC that it had unearned legal fees in its trust account of approximately $148,000, and that Gutierrez controlled an offshore bank account that had approximately $450,000 on deposit, when the court ordered the asset freeze.  Gutierrez subsequently used these funds for his personal legal defense and other expenses.  , As a result of Garderes violations of the court orders, the Special Masters efforts to administer the assets maintained for investors was significantly impaired.  The SEC and Special Master believe that the $2 million being paid is appropriate compensation for the damages caused by Garderes failure to comply with the court orders.  , Previously in the Sharp litigation, the Special Master recovered more than $17 million, much of which already has been distributed to victims of the scheme.  In addition, Gutierrez has pled guilty to criminal fraud charges brought by a federal grand jury in conjunction with the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Northern District of Texas and is awaiting sentencing.

The Court ordered Hughes to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $120,000, permanently enjoined him from future violations of the insider transactions reporting provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 16a-3 thereunder, and prohibited Hughes from acting as an officer or director of a publicly traded company., In its complaint, filed August 7, 2002, the SEC alleged that Glendale, California, based eConnect (OTCBB:  ECNT) and Hughes, eConnects former president, issued false and misleading press releases and posted false statements on eConnects websites in July 2002.  These statements concerned a purported $20 million investment of AA rated bonds that in fact were not rated, a nonexistent stock repurchase program, and a purported $964,000 purchase order for eConnects principal product.

The Commissions district court complaint alleges that Steckler assisted two former Legato sales executives in drafting a side letter in connection with an order by Logicon to purchase Legato software for resale to the U.S. Air Force.  The side letter granted Logicon the right to cancel the transaction, and noted that the cancellation provision could not appear on the face of Logicons purchase order because of the impact on revenue recognition.  Unaware of the side letter and the cancellation provision, Legatos finance department caused the company to recognize revenue on the order.  As a result of this transaction, Legatos original Form 10-Q for the Sept 30, 1999, quarter improperly overstated the companys net income by approximately $2 million (146%).  Legato later restated this income, and the transaction was ultimately cancelled following the discovery of the side letter., The complaint charges that Steckler aided and abetted Legato and certain of its former officers in violating the antifraud provisions of the securities laws, (Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; provisions prohibiting the circumvention of Legatos internal accounting controls and falsification of its records, (Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1; and provisions requiring the company to provide accurate periodic reports and make and keep accurate books and records (Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder).  The complaint seeks a permanent injunction against future violations by Steckler, as well as monetary penalties., In May 2002, the Commission sued Legatos former executive vice president of worldwide sales, David Malmstedt, and its former vice president of sales for North America, Mark Huetteman, for securities fraud for their roles in causing Legato to overstate its financial results for fiscal 1999.

The Commissions complaint alleged that Colt orchestrated the manipulative scheme, including the hiring of Magnum to post a false and misleading buy recommendation, the distribution of mass e-mails or spam containing fraudulent statements, issuing a false and misleading press release, and placing the release onto New Energys website.

Delaney of New Jersey, Nicole M. Shkedi of New Jersey, and Thomas J. Donovan of New York - with engaging in a trading scheme that defrauded Knight of approximately $1.4 million.  The Commission also issued a related administrative order charging a fourth individual - Charles C. Campbell of New Jersey - with being a cause of the violations by two of the former Knight traders.  Delaney, Shkedi, and Campbell each settled the proceedings against them without admitting or denying the Commissions charges, while Donovan is contesting the charges., In its complaint in federal court, the Commission alleged that Delaney, Shkedi, and Donovan were all formerly employed by Knight as equity traders responsible for making markets in specific equity securities.  The Commission further alleged that, as equity traders, the defendants had discretionary trading authority over Knight trading accounts maintained for the purpose of carrying out Knights business as a market maker in these specific stocks.  According to the Commission, from at least March 2001 through February 2002, the three former traders abused their positions at Knight by knowingly and intentionally executing fraudulent stock trades from the Knight proprietary accounts they controlled at prices guaranteed to generate profits in private brokerage accounts that they also controlled.  The Commission alleged that the defendants trading scheme defrauded Knight of approximately $1.4 million, which Knight has since recovered from Delaney.  , The complaint charges Delaney, Shkedi, and Donovan with committing securities fraud in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.  Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Delaney and Shkedi have consented to the courts entry of final judgments that would permanently enjoin them from violating the foregoing provisions of the securities laws, as well as to the Commissions issuance of administrative orders that would bar them from associating with any registered broker or dealer based on the federal courts anticipated entry of injunctions against them.  Shkedi also has consented to pay $25,000 in civil penalties, half of which would be paid to the New Jersey Bureau of Securities, which has filed contemporaneous charges against Delaney, Shkedi, and Donovan.  The Commission is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of unlawful gains, and civil penalties against Donovan, who is contesting the Commissions charges., In its administrative order against Campbell, the Commission found that Campbell opened an online brokerage account which he knew or should have known was being used by two of the former Knight traders to facilitate their unlawful trading scheme, that Campbell was an indirect beneficiary of the fraudulent trading in the account, and that Campbell was therefore a cause of the securities law violations by those two former Knight traders.  Based on these findings, the Commission ordered Campbell to cease and desist from committing or causing such violations in the future.

First, the Commission filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia charging Schering with violating Regulation FD and Section 13(a) and seeking a civil monetary penalty.  Second, the Commission issued an administrative order finding that Schering violated the same provisions, and that the companys former chairman and chief executive officer, Richard J. Kogan, was a cause of Scherings violations.  <i>In the Matter of Schering-Plough Corporation and Richard J. Kogan</i>, Admin. Proc. No. 3-11249,  Exchange Act Rel. No. 34-48461 (September 9, 2003).

The Commission further charged that, at each of these meetings, through a combination of spoken language, tone, emphasis, and demeanor, Kogan disclosed negative and material, nonpublic information regarding Scherings earnings prospects, including that analysts earnings estimates for Scherings 2002 third-quarter were too high, and that Scherings earnings in 2003 would significantly decline.  According to the Commission, immediately after the meetings, analysts at Fidelity and Putnam downgraded their ratings on Schering, and portfolio managers at those firms and at Wellington heavily sold Schering stock.  Fidelity and Putnam each sold more than 10 million shares of Schering stock over a three-day period following the meetings, accounting for more than 30 percent of the overall market for that period.  The price of Scherings stock declined during this period by more than 17 percent, from $21.32 to $17.64 per share, on approximately four times normal volume.  , The Commission further charged that, on October 3, 2002, in the midst of this sell-off, Kogan held a previously scheduled private meeting with approximately 25 analysts and portfolio managers at Scherings New Jersey headquarters, during which he said, among other things, that Scherings 2003 earnings would be terrible.

Simultaneously with the filing of its action, the Commission accepted Klingers offer of settlement, in which he agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations, to a court order enjoining him from future violations of the securities laws and requiring him to pay approximately $18,000 in wrongful trading profits and penalties.,  According to the complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, Klinger, in the course of his employment as a vice-president and senior loan officer at Washington Mutual, Inc., obtained material non-public information that Beazer, a Washington Mutual customer, was planning to acquire Crossman.  Based on that information, Klinger purchased 700 shares of Crossman common stock on January 28, 2002. On January 30, 2002, Crossman and Beazer issued a joint public announcement about the acquisition, and Crossmans stock price increased approximately 47 percent from the previous days closing price.  On January 31, 2002, the day after the acquisition was publicly announced, Klinger sold his entire holdings of Crossman shares, generating trading profits of $9,135., Until its acquisition, Crossman was a home building company based in Indianapolis, Indiana, whose securities were registered with the Commission and traded on the Nasdaq National Market System.  Beazer is a home building company headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, whose securities are registered with the Commission and traded on the New York Stock Exchange., In order to settle the charges, Klinger agreed to the entry of an order permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10(b)-5 thereunder.  Additionally, Klinger agreed to pay disgorgement of $9,135 in illegal trading profits, plus $297.13 in prejudgment interest; and to pay a civil money penalty equal to his trading profits in the amount of $9,135.  , In accepting Klingers settlement, the Commission took into account Klingers significant cooperation in the staffs investigation, including the fact that he voluntarily contacted the staff to self-report his trades and worked with the staff to resolve this matter promptly.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18333.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Commission filed a complaint against Spruill on December 16, 1999, alleging that he participated in a commission kickback scheme perpetrated by Alan Brian Bond, the then principal of a registered investment adviser.  The Commissions complaint alleged that Bond received over $6.9 million in commission kickbacks from three brokerage firms with which Spruill was associated.  The Commissions action against Bond is continuing. , Spruill, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

Ben F. Glisan, Jr.</i>, Case No. H-03-3628   (S.D. Tx.)</h2>, <h2 align=CENTER>SEC CHARGES BEN F. GLISAN, JR., ENRONS FORMER TREASURER, WITH SECURITIES FRAUD</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) today charged Ben F. Glisan, Jr. with violations of the anti-fraud, lying to auditors, periodic reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws.  The Commissions complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Houston, alleges that Glisan participated in Enrons manipulation of its reported financial results through a series of fraudulent transactions designed to inflate Enrons earnings and operating cash flows, while at the same time concealing the full extent of its debt.  The fraudulent transactions included the Raptor sham hedges used by Enron to avoid earnings write-downs of over $1 billion, the fraudulent sale of an interest in Nigerian barges to Merrill Lynch, and prepay transactions, which were loans disguised as commodity sales contracts, used by Enron to overstate its cash flows by hundreds of millions of dollars., Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint, Glisan agreed to file a consent and final judgment settling the Commissions action against him.  In the consent, Glisan has agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating, directly or indirectly, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2.  Glisan has also agreed to the entry of an officer and director bar against him.   , The Commissions complaint alleges that Glisan and others used the Raptors to manipulate Enrons financial statements.  Raptor I was created in April 2000 through an off balance sheet SPE, called Talon LLC.  Enron formed Talon to hedge against potential declines in certain of its mark-to-market investments.  Although Enron provided most of Talons funding, $30 million of its funding was from LJM2 Co-Investment, L.P. (the entity formed by Enrons former CFO, Andrew Fastow, to transact business with Enron), representing the purported 3% outside equity required for Talon to be off Enrons balance sheet.  Glisan knew that Talon was not properly off Enrons balance sheet because it would not engage in hedging with transactions with Enron until LJM2 was no longer at risk.  Glisan and others removed the risk by Enron and Talon entering into a put, that is, a transaction that purportedly served to hedge Enron against a decline in its own stock value.  Although it had no true business purpose, Enron purchased the put option for $41 million.  The put was designed by Glisan and others as an ostensible reason to make a distribution of $41 million to LJM2, economically providing a return of and return on capital.  Accordingly, Talon failed to meet the minimum equity test as required by the accounting rules for off balance sheet treatment.  , The Commissions complaint also alleges that, at year-end 1999, Enron sold to Merrill Lynch an interest in certain Nigerian power producing barges.  Merrill Lynch purchased the interest only after Enron orally guaranteed that Merrill Lynch would not lose money, would receive a generous return, and would be taken out of the deal within six months.  The transaction was necessary for Enron to meet year-end reporting requirements, including recognition of $12 million in earnings and $28 million in funds flow.  Glisan was aware of the oral guarantee, as well as of the accounting goals driving the transaction.  He took an active role in making sure that Merrill Lynch was taken out within six months at the promised rate of return, thereby preserving for Enron the accounting benefits previously recognized., Finally, the Commissions complaint alleges that Glisan and others participated in Enrons manipulation of its reported financial results through a series of complex structured-finance transactions, called prepays, over a period of several years preceding Enrons bankruptcy.  Enron used these transactions to report loans from financial institutions as cash from operating activities.  Indeed, the structural complexity of these transactions had no business purpose aside from masking the fact that, in substance, they were loans to Enron.  (See<i> </i><u>SEC v. J.P. Morgan Chase</u>, Civil. Action No. H-03-2877 (S.D.Tex.) and <u>In the Matter of Citigroup, Inc.</u>, Administrative Proceeding File No. 3-11192 (SEC).)  As a result of the conduct of Glisan and others, Enron materially overstated its reported net cash flow from operating activities, materially understated its reported net cash flow from financing activities, and misrepresented the amount it borrowed., The Commission brought this action in coordination with the U.S. Department of Justice Enron Task Force.  The Commissions investigation is continuing.  , Please contact Charles Clark (202-942-4731) for more information.  , For additional information, see:, <i> SEC v. Michael J.

Prater and his company, Wellspring Capital Group, Inc., in connection with a Ponzi scheme operated over the Internet and by other means.  The Commission alleged in its complaint, filed on September 5, 2003, that Prater and Wellspring fraudulently promised investors returns as high as 1,000 percent per year in connection with the scheme. The Honorable Peter C. Dorsey, United States District Judge for the District of Connecticut, granted the TRO and asset freeze after an ex parte hearing in federal court in New Haven on Monday, September 8. The courts order was based on the Commissions prima facie showing that Prater and Wellspring had engaged in securities fraud and other violations of the federal securities laws.  , According to the Commissions complaint, Prater, of Guilford Connecticut, and Wellspring, also headquartered in Guilford, Connecticut, operated a sophisticated Internet Ponzi scheme that raised at least $3 million from thousands of investors.  The Commissions complaint alleged that Praters scheme used a series of interrelated Internet web sites and a network of agents operating throughout the United States to guarantee prospective investors exorbitant returns through a variety of programs.  According to the Commissions complaint, under one set of programs, Prater, through Wellspring, promised that, in exchange for a small sum of money, it would pay investors returns as high as 1,000 percent per year in the form of payments for various living expenses of the investors, such as car loans, rent, or business expenses.  The Commissions complaint alleged that Wellspring claimed it used the investor funds to invest in a portfolio of companies, and that the profits from the portfolio, in turn, paid for the exorbitant returns to investors.  According to the Commissions complaint, Wellspring also offered investors the opportunity to invest directly in the portfolio of companies.  In this aspect of the scheme as well, Prater guaranteed investors a profit and made misrepresentations about the companies in the portfolio and about his own qualifications.  The Commissions complaint further alleged that Prater also failed to disclose his criminal history, which includes forgery and fraud convictions, to investors.  According to the Commissions complaint, Wellspring also operated out of satellite offices in St. Albans, Vermont, and elsewhere.    , The Commission alleged in its Complaint that Prater and Wellspring violated anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission also alleged that the defendants violated the registration provisions of the securities laws, namely Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933., The case has now been assigned to the Honorable Mark R. Kravitz.  The Commission obtained entry of an order temporarily restraining Prater and Wellspring from directly or indirectly continuing to violate the federal securities laws, an asset freeze, and other emergency relief.

The prosecution of the matter was handled as part of the Securities Fraud Initiative, a coordinated effort by the SECs Southeast Regional Office (in Miami), the USAO, and other agencies, to combat securities fraud in South Florida., Blissett pled guilty today to conspiracy to commit securities fraud, based on the same misconduct that led the SEC to take action.  According to an Information filed by the USAO, Blissett solicited investors to purchase promissory notes issued by his company, A.B. Financing and Investments, Inc. (ABFI).  According to the Information, Blissett used sales materials that contained many materially false statements and omissions, some of which are described below, to induce investors to purchase ABFI notes. , The Information to which Blissett pled guilty states that from at least July 1989 to December 2002, ABFI raised more than $51.9 million from at least 2000 investors, and that investors lost approximately $27.3 million., The SEC filed its emergency civil action against Blissett and ABFI on December 6, 2002.

AIG Settles Action and Agrees to Pay $10 Million Penalty</h2>]","[Washington  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed a civil accounting fraud action in federal district court in the Southern District of New York against American International Group, Inc. (AIG), Brightpoint, Inc. (Brightpoint) and two former officers and a former employee of Brightpoint, respectively, Phillip Bounsall (Bounsall), John Delaney (Delaney) and Timothy Harcharik (Harcharik).  All of the defendants except Harcharik have consented to the entry of final judgments in settlement of this matter.  The Commission also announced today that it instituted separate settled cease-and-desist proceedings against Brightpoint, AIG, Bounsall and an AIG employee.  , The civil and administrative actions involve the role played by AIG, one of the worlds largest insurance underwriters, in enabling Brightpoint, a public reporting company, to commit securities fraud.  As a sophisticated financial services provider, AIG played an indispensable part in the fraudulent transaction by selling Brightpoint a new insurance product that AIG had developed and marketed for the specific purpose of helping issuers to report false financial information to the public.  , Beginning in 1997, AIG developed and marketed a so-called non-traditional insurance product for the stated purpose of income statement smoothing, <u>i.e.</u>, enabling a public reporting company to spread the recognition of known and quantified one-time losses over several future reporting periods.  The key to achieving the desired accounting result was to create the appearance of insurance, <u>i.e.</u>, that the insured (Brightpoint) was paying premiums in return for an assumption of risk by AIG, when, in fact, Brightpoint was merely depositing cash with AIG that AIG refunded to Brightpoint.  , In this case, AIG issued such a purported insurance policy to Brightpoint for the purpose of assisting Brightpoint to conceal $11.9 million in losses that Brightpoint sustained in 1998.  Brightpoints chief accounting officer, Delaney, and its director of risk management, Harcharik, negotiated the purported policy with an AIG assistant vice president.  Brightpoints chief financial officer, Bounsall, approved the insurance transaction without adequately reviewing it.  As a result of the transaction, Brightpoints 1998 financial statements, as reported in the 1998 Form 10-K, overstated Brightpoints actual net income before taxes by 61 percent.  The misrepresentation was subsequently republished in a registration statement filed in September 1999 and in Forms 10-K for 1999 and 2000., Specifically, the Commission alleged in the civil action that: , Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, all of the defendants except Harcharik have agreed to settle the Commissions charges.  In connection with the settlements, AIG agreed to pay a civil penalty of $10 million, Brightpoint agreed to pay a civil penalty of $450,000, Delaney agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000 and consented to the entry of a Final Judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and permanently bars him from serving as an officer or director of any public company, and Bounsall agreed to pay a civil penalty of $45,000., With regard to Harcharik, the Commissions complaint seeks the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws and ordering him to pay civil penalties., Without admitting or denying the facts set forth in their respective administrative orders, AIG, Brightpoint and Bounsall also consented to the issuance of separate cease-and-desist orders.  Specifically, AIG and Brightpoint consented to the issuance of separate orders (i) finding that each violated the antifraud provisions of the Exchange Act and, in the case of Brightpoint, the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act and the reporting provisions of the Exchange Act, and (ii) directing that AIG and Brightpoint, respectively, cease and desist from further violating those provisions.  In addition, AIG consented to pay $100,000 in disgorgement and to retain an independent consultant to make recommendations to ensure that AIGs insurance products will not be used in the future to violate the securities laws.  Bounsall consented to the issuance of a separate order (i) finding that he was a cause of Brightpoints violation of the books-and-records provisions of Rule 13b2-1 of the Exchange Act and (ii) directing him to cease and desist from further violating that provision.  , Brightpoint is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Plainfield, Indiana that provides outsourced services such as distribution, fulfillment, customized packaging, prepaid and e-business solutions, and inventory management in the wireless telecommunications and data industry.

Woy, former officers of defunct Smart-Mart, Inc., were indicted on July 23, 2003 by a federal grand jury for securities fraud and related offenses in connection with their operation of the Dallas-based company.  The defendants conduct was the subject of a successful enforcement action brought by the Securities and Exhange Commission in 2001. , The 49-count indictment, obtained by the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Texas (Dallas Division), alleges that McMurray, Woy and three additional defendants fraudulently raised approximately $2.4 million from more than 700 investors by soliciting them to invest money and purchase stock in the Internet-based retailer company, falsely representing that the funds would be used for company operations and business development., As a result of its lawsuit, the Commission, in October 2002, succeeded in obtaining permanent injunctions against McMurray, Woy and Smart-Mart, which enjoin each defendant from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Further, McMurray was ordered to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $261,438 and barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and Woy was ordered to pay disgorgement of $25,000. , The Commissions civil action alleged that from March 1998 through February 1999, Smart-Mart raised approximately $2.4 million from approximately 720 investors located nationwide and in Canada through the sale of common stock, and that Smart-Mart, McMurray and Woy made false and misleading statements to investors regarding an impending initial public offering (IPO), the business prospects of the company, the use of investor funds, and the liquidity and return on investment.  Moreover, the Commission charged that Smart-Mart never took any significant steps to conduct an IPO and, in fact, had minimal business operations.  Additionally, the Commission alleged that McMurray and Woy used a large portion of investor funds for unauthorized business and personal expenses.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18342.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Christine B. Hoberg,</i> United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Civil Action No. C 03-04135 HRL</h2>]","[The United States Securities and Exchange Commission announced today the filing of financial reporting fraud charges against Christine B. Hoberg, former chief financial officer of Nvidia Corporation, alleging that she purposefully failed to record $3.3 million in expenses relating to a deal with a supplier.  As a result of that transaction, the complaint alleges, Nvidia materially overstated its gross profit and income for the quarter ended April 30, 2000., Hoberg, 48, of Los Altos, California, was charged in a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.  Simultaneous with the filing of the complaint, and without admitting or denying the allegations, Hoberg consented to a court order directing her to pay $671,694.99 (including $596,694.99 in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and prejudgment interest and $75,000 in penalties), prohibiting her from serving as an officer or director of any public company for five years, and enjoining her from violations of the antifraud and other provisions of the securities laws., According to the complaint against Hoberg, in early 2000 Nvidia was lagging behind expectations for its financial performance for the quarter ended April 30, 2000.  In order to meet those expectations, Nvidia entered into an agreement with a supplier in which the supplier granted Nvidia $3.3 million in cost reduction credits for the April 30 quarter.  In exchange, though, Nvidia agreed to repay the supplier this same amount by paying artificially higher prices on purchases later in the year., Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Nvidias explicit agreement to repay the costs to its supplier created a liability that Nvidia was required to record in its accounting records.  Thus, under GAAP, Nvidia should have recorded both the cost reductions and an offsetting liability for its agreement to repay the costs in the future., Instead, Hoberg directed that Nvidia record only the cost reductions portion of the transaction on its books for the April 30 quarter.  By failing to record the offsetting $3.3 million liability for the second portion of the deal, Hoberg led Nvidia to overstate its gross profit and income for the quarter by 6.4% and 15.3%, respectively., To facilitate the fraud, Hoberg directed that Nvidia document the deal in two separate agreements, with the cost reductions described in one agreement, and Nvidias promise to repay described in another.  During a subsequent review of Nvidias quarterly results by its outside auditors, Hoberg provided the auditors with the agreement relating to Nvidias cost reductions, but withheld the agreement that described Nvidias promise to repay the costs in the future., The complaint charges Hoberg with financial reporting fraud (Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder), withholding material facts from auditors (Rule 13b2-2 under the Exchange Act), and falsifying Nvidias books and records (Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act an Rule 13b2-1 thereunder).  Simultaneous with the filing of the complaint, Hoberg agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations, to a judgment permanently enjoining her from violations of these provisions and to the other relief described above.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18343.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

United States District Court for the Central District of California, Case No. LACV 03-6499 CAS (VBKx) (September 11, 2003)
</h2>]","[Defendant DAngelo Pleads Guilty in Related Criminal Action Brought by U.S. Attorneys Office for the Central District of California, The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Central District of California charging Kenneth P. DAngelo and his company, RBF International, Inc., with participating in an unlawful scheme to manipulate the stock price of GenesisIntermedia, Inc. (GENI), a now defunct public company that was based in Van Nuys, California.  The Commission alleges that the scheme, which occurred between September 1999 and September 2001, resulted in the misappropriation of more than $130 million, the collapse of three broker-dealers, and the largest bailout in the history of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation. , According to the complaint, the manipulation of GENIs stock price began shortly after the companys June 1999 public offering.  To benefit from the manipulation, GENIs Chief Executive Officer developed a stock lending scheme.  The Commission alleges that the CEO and an accomplice loaned approximately 15 million shares of GENI stock to Native Nations Securities, Inc., a New Jersey broker-dealer, and more than a dozen other broker-dealers in exchange for approximately $130 million.  To facilitate these stock loan transactions, DAngelo defrauded those broker-dealers by leading them to believe that reputable brokerage firms were lending the GENI shares to them.  The complaint alleges that the GENI shares actually were being loaned by Ultimate Holdings, Ltd., which was an offshore entity controlled by GENIs CEO and his accomplice.  The stock loans generated cash proceeds for the full market value of the GENI shares and assured that Ultimate Holdings and the CEO would benefit from future price increases.  According to the complaint, DAngelo secretly paid others for their assistance in this scheme., The complaint alleges that, in a typical stock loan transaction, Ultimate Holdings loaned stock to a broker-dealer and received the current market value of the stock in cash.  As GENIs stock price fluctuated, the loaned stock was marked-to-market by the broker-dealer.  In a hypothetical example, if Ultimate Holdings loaned a broker-dealer 1,000 shares of stock valued at $5.00 per share, Ultimate Holdings would get $5,000 from the broker-dealer and the broker-dealer would take possession of the stock.  If the price of the stock subsequently rose to $6.00 per share, Ultimate Holdings would get another $1,000 from the broker-dealer.  If the stock then dropped to $4.00 per share, Ultimate Holdings would be obligated to return $2,000 to the broker-dealer.  Ultimate Holdings received additional cash when GENIs price increased, and was obligated to return cash when the stock price dropped.  By lending the shares in this manner, rather than selling them, Ultimate Holdings and GENIs CEO: (i) raised substantial sums of money without giving up control of the stock or depressing the market; (ii) generated funds used in part to buy more GENI shares and drive up the market price; and (iii) prevented the shares from being used for short sales., According to the complaint, GENIs CEO, his accomplice and DAngelo inflated GENIs stock price by systematically engaging in fraudulent and deceptive practices that had the intended effect of generating additional cash proceeds from the broker-dealers participating in the stock loan transactions.  Their illegal manipulative activities included (i) reducing the supply of GENI stock to control the public float; (ii) promoting a short squeeze; (iii) making trades through nominee accounts; and (iv) engaging in a free-riding scheme.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, while these activities were ongoing, the CEO was secretly compensating a well-known financial commentator to tout GENI on CNBC, Bloomberg TV, CNN and CNNfn, thereby creating demand for the stock, and making false and misleading statements in periodic reports filed with the Commission and in press releases issued by the company (with assistance from GENIs former Chief Financial Officer)., The manipulation caused GENIs stock price to increase approximately 1,400%, from a low of $1.67 per share (split adjusted) on September 1, 1999 to a high of $25 per share on June 29, 2001.  After the scheme collapsed in September 2001, GENIs stock price plunged to pennies per share.  GENIs CEO and his accomplice then defaulted on the obligations of Ultimate Holdings to repay approximately $130 million they had obtained from loaning GENI shares to the various broker-dealers, which caused three of the firms to go bankrupt., According to the complaint, DAngelo and RBF International violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  As relief, the Commission is seeking permanent injunctions, an accounting of all the money that DAngelo and RBF International obtained as a result of their illegal conduct, disgorgement (with prejudgment interest), and civil penalties., Also today, the United States Attorneys Office for the Central District of California filed related criminal charges against DAngelo.  He has entered a guilty plea and is waiting to be sentenced. , The Commission acknowledges the cooperation of the United States Attorneys Office for the Central District of California and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18344.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18344.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Price,</i> United States District Court for the District of Columbia, Civil Action No. 1:03cv01905</h2>]","[The Commission announced today that it has instituted a settled cease-and-desist proceeding against Stephen D. Price, of Bronxville, New York, a former Vice-President for Business Development at CAIS Internet, Inc., now known as Ardent Communications, Inc.  The Commission also filed a complaint in federal court seeking a civil penalty against Price.  Without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, or the allegations in the complaint, Price consented to the issuance of a cease-and-desist order, and a judgment ordering him to pay a $20,000 penalty.  The Commissions Order finds that Price violated the federal securities laws by concealing information about a significant sale from CAISs management and accountants, which led CAIS to file materially false and misleading financial statements with the Commission., The Order finds that in September 2000, Price agreed to sell more than $1 million of Internet kiosks to a private company, subject to an oral side agreement requiring CAIS to make a multi-million dollar investment in the private company.  According to the Order, Price knew that the customer would return the kiosks to CAIS if the promised investment was not made.  The Order finds that Price concealed details about the investment from CAISs management and accountants, and that his conduct led CAIS to file materially false financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2000.  The Order finds that Price violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws because he knew that CAIS would record the sale as revenue in the third quarter and overstate its results.  The Order also finds that, due to his misconduct, Price was a cause of CAISs violations of the reporting and recordkeeping provisions of the federal securities laws., The Commission found that Price violated Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and was a cause of CAISs violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder.

The SECs complaint against VCI, Life Investment, York and Coyne, alleges that they have engaged in a systematic fraud in connection with a scheme to solicit investment in various limited liability companies (LLCs) that invested in viatical settlements (i.e., a life insurance policy of a terminally ill person that is sold at a price less than the face value of the policy).  , According to the SECs complaint, VCI prepared and disseminated quarterly statements to investors representing that certain LLCs owned viaticated insurance policies even though those policies had been rescinded, terminated or cancelled.  The complaint also alleges that many of the viatical settlements in VCIs portfolio were fraudulently obtained, making the policies subject to cancellation, and that they were acquired from an unlicensed viatical settlement provider.  In addition, the Complaint alleges that VCI, York and Coyne misrepresented and omitted to disclose material facts concerning the investment, including risk factors, rates of return, planned public offerings, and the checkered disciplinary histories of VCI, its related entities, and York and Coyne. The Complaint also alleges that VCI, York and Coyne misused investor proceeds by, among other things, using a quarter million dollars of investor funds to fund York and Coynes own boat-leasing venture.  Finally, the Complaint alleges that Life Investment recently filed with the SEC materially false and misleading registration statements in its attempt to become a public company (According to offering materials provided to investors, Life Investment would acquire the assets of each LLC, and conduct an initial public offering).  , As a result, the SEC alleges that VCI, York and Coyne violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c), and of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act); and that all defendants violated Sections 17(a)(1), (2) and (3) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5, thereunder.

The Order requires that the Independent Examiners report be included in the filings for this matter, and also requires that the report be posted on the official website for the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (<a href=/cgi-bin/goodbye.cgi?http://www.ilnd.uscourts.gov>http://www.ilnd.uscourts.gov</a>) on September 15, 2003., The Court found that the Independent Examiners Report discussed Spiegels financial condition and identified material accounting irregularities.  In the Order, Judge Zagel found that the information contained in the Independent Examiners September 5, 2003 Report is material to the investing public and that it is in the public interest to make the Independent Examiners Report available to the public.  , The Independent Examiners Report was completed as a result of Spiegels partial settlement with the Securities and Exhange Commission (Commission) in this matter.  On March 7, 2003, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action alleging that Spiegel, Inc. (Spiegel) violated the federal securities laws by withholding material information from the public.  Spiegel consented to the entry of a permanent injunction without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint.  The complaint alleged that Spiegel withheld the fact that on or about the beginning of 2002, its independent auditor had notified Spiegel that it may not be able to continue as a going concern.  The complaint further alleged that Spiegels independent auditor later issued an audit report on or about January or February 2002 which stated that the audit firm had substantial doubts about Spiegels ability to continue as a going concern., The complaint alleged that Spiegel decided not to make its required 10-K and 10-Q filings to conceal the going concern issue from the public.  Instead, the company filed a series of Forms NT (notices of late filing) indicating that Spiegel was not in a position to file because various lending agreements were not in place.  According to the complaint, statements made by Spiegel executives confirm that Spiegel chose not to make its required filings to avoid disclosing the going concern notice and to avoid the negative disruptions that the disclosure of this information would cause.  The complaint further alleged that Spiegel failed to disclose its auditors going concern notice in various press releases and public statements that discussed the companys financial condition., As a partial settlement with the Commission, Spiegel consented to the entry of a permanent injunction for violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1 and 13a-13 promulgated thereunder, which was entered on March 11, 2003, as amended on March 27, 2003.  The partial settlement required the appointment of an Independent Examiner whose mandate was to prepare a report discussing Spiegels financial condition and identifying any accounting irregularities.  The Court will determine at a later date whether it is appropriate for Spiegel to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest and/or civil penalties., The Commissions investigation in this matter continues.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18347.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Turant, Jr., of Wapwallopen, Pennsylvania, Russ R. Luciano, of Duryea, Pennsylvania and four entities operated by them, alleging an offering fraud in which the defendants raised approximately $4.5 million from more than 100 investors., The Commissions complaint alleges that, from July 1999 until March 2003, Turant and Luciano solicited funds by falsely representing to prospective investors that they would invest their money in one of two purported hedge funds, defendants JTI Group Fund, LP and Evergreen Investment Group, LP, for the purpose of day-trading securities, promising annual returns from 20% to 120%.  The complaint alleges that, in fact, only a small portion of the money raised was ever invested, that the funds were never profitable, and that much of the money that was invested was lost.  Turant and Luciano then concealed their scheme and lulled investors by providing fictitious monthly account statements and other false documents to investors., The complaint further alleges that, of the $4.5 million raised, Turant and Luciano used more than $3.8 million for unauthorized purposes, including paying approximately $2.2 million to existing investors, in the nature of a Ponzi scheme.  In addition, Turant and Luciano misappropriated almost $1 million for their personal use., Named as defendants in the Commissions action are Turant, Luciano, JTI Group Fund, LP, Evergreen Investment Group, LP and the general partners of the funds, JTI Investment Group, Inc. and New Resource Investment Group, Inc., The complaint charges all of the defendants with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and defendants JTI Group Fund, LP and Evergreen Investment Group, LP with violating Section 7(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

(Cantor), and John L. Milling (Milling).  The defendants filed no opposition to the Commissions motion and ultimately consented to the relief.  Entered on September 5, 2003, the courts order continues in place various forms of interim relief initially ordered by the court on July 25, 2003, when the court granted the Commissions application for a temporary restraining order and other relief to halt the fraud perpetrated by Tecumseh and the other defendants.  Among other things, the courts September 5, 2003 order preliminarily enjoins:  (a) Tecumseh, Tradevest, Cantor and Milling from committing future violations of the registration provisions, Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act); (b) Tecumseh, Tradevest and Milling from future violations of the antifraud provisions, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (c) Cantor from future violations of the broker-dealer books and records provisions, Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4 thereunder; and (d) Milling from aiding and abetting future violations of the broker-dealer books and records provisions, Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4 thereunder.  The order also:  (a) continues a freeze over the assets of those defendants and relief defendants Tecumseh Alpha Fund LP (Alpha Fund) and Tecumseh Alpha LLC (Alpha LLC); and (b) keeps in place Loretta E. Lynch as the court-appointed receiver for Tecumseh, Tradevest, and Cantor.  At the request of defendant Milling, the order also imposes a limited stay of discovery and stays defendants time to respond to the Commissions complaint pending resolution of a criminal investigation.  The order allows the Commission, however, to take third-party discovery notwithstanding the stay. , The Commissions complaint, filed on July 24, 2003, alleges that, beginning in June 2000, the defendants engaged in a fraud arising out of the unregistered offer and sale of securities in Tecumseh, a purported financial services company with offices in New Jersey and California, and Tecumsehs subsidiary, Tradevest.  Tecumseh and Tradevest conducted the fraud largely through the efforts of Milling, a securities lawyer and Tecumsehs senior official.  According to the complaint, Tecumseh, Tradevest and Milling acted with the assistance of defendants Cantor, a registered broker-dealer; Gerard A. McCallion, Cantors President; Anthony M. Palovchik, Tecumsehs Vice President; and Dale Carone, manager of Tecumsehs California office; and others.  Through the unregistered fraudulent offerings, the defendants together raised approximately $10 million from about 500 investors nationwide.  The complaint also names as relief defendants three Tecumseh affiliates:  Alpha Fund, Alpha LLC, and Stracq, Inc., The complaint alleges that Tecumseh, Tradevest and Milling induced investors to acquire securities of Tecumseh and Tradevest by means of a host of material misrepresentations.

In connection with the offering of Safetynet stock, the defendants made numerous material misrepresentations and omissions to prospective and actual investors regarding, among other things, Safetynets business operations, projected revenues and profitability, use of investor proceeds and projected rate of return on the investment.  In addition, Mulhearn misappropriated much of the monies raised for his personal use, and Balboa and Delgado collectively received over $100,000 in undisclosed commissions and bonuses.

The SEC also announced the filing of civil charges against the former CEO and CFO of a Homestore vendor for assisting in the fraudulent scheme at Homestore.  All of the defendants have agreed to settle the Commissions lawsuit and to cooperate with the government in its ongoing investigation.  Additionally, three of them have agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges., With these charges, the SEC has now charged a total of 11 individuals for their roles in a financial fraud scheme at Homestore, 7 of whom have been criminally charged by the United States Attorney in Los Angeles., The civil and criminal actions allege that the defendants structured and negotiated fraudulent round-trip transactions for the purpose of artificially inflating Homestores on-line advertising revenues to exceed Wall Street analysts expectations, even though these transactions had no economic substance.  In these round-trip transactions, Homestore paid inflated sums to various vendors for services or products, and, in turn, the vendors used these funds to buy advertising from two media companies.  The media companies then bought advertising from Homestore, and Homestore improperly recorded the money it received from the sale of such advertising as revenue in its financial statements.  The essence of these transactions was a circular flow of money by which Homestore recognized its own cash as revenue., All of the Homestore employees charged today were directly involved in setting up these illegal round-trip transactions.  These defendants also participated in misleading Homestores outside auditors to prevent discovery of the true nature of the round-trip transactions.  This included altering websites and press releases of vendor companies to eliminate incriminating information, preparing and backdating documents, and using false addresses for related businesses.  In addition, several salespeople charged today personally profited from the illegal transactions by accepting kickbacks from vendors or by engaging in insider trading in Homestores stock.  In one case, a former Homestore salesperson routed payment of a kickback through offshore bank accounts in Lebanon and Uganda in an effort to avoid detection., The SECs civil complaint and the United States Attorneys criminal information, filed today in United States District Court in Los Angeles, charges the following three defendants.  , In addition, the SECs civil complaint also charges the following four defendants., The SEC charged the defendants variously with violating or aiding and abetting violations of numerous provisions of the federal securities laws, including the antifraud provisions, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; reporting provisions, Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder; record-keeping provisions, Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder; internal controls provisions, Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act; and lying to the auditors provisions, Rule 13b2-2 under the Exchange Act., The Justice Departments criminal action charges Thomas Vo and Sailesh Patel with one count of wire fraud, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1343, and Jessica McLellan with one count of securities fraud, in violation of Title 15, United States Code, Sections 78j(b) and 78ff, and Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 240.10b-5., Vo, Patel and McLellan have agreed to settle the SECs lawsuit, to plead guilty to the criminal charges, and to cooperate with the government in its ongoing investigations.  Kabler, Richards, Slayton and Weigand, who were not charged in the criminal case, have also agreed to settle the SECs lawsuit.  All seven individuals settled the SEC lawsuit without admitting or denying the allegations, simultaneously with the filing of the complaint.  Vo, Patel and McLellan are expected to appear in court on the criminal charges in October 2003., In the SEC case, Kabler will be enjoined from committing future violations of the charged federal securities laws, will repay $530,119 in profits from her exercise of Homestore stock options and commissions she earned during the fraud, plus interest, and will pay a $120,000 civil penalty.

In the criminal case, Patel faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine., In her SEC settlement, McLellan will be enjoined from committing future violations of the charged federal securities laws and will pay $38,160, representing her profits from trading in Homestore stock, commissions, interest and a civil penalty.

Richards will also be suspended from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an accountant., Slayton settled the SECs action by consenting to the entry of an administrative cease-and-desist order prohibiting him from committing or causing future violations of the charged federal securities laws.  He also consented to the entry of a district court judgment ordering him to pay $35,001 in civil penalties and disgorgement., Weigand also settled the SECs action by consenting to the entry of an administrative cease-and-desist order prohibiting him from committing or causing future violations of the charged federal securities laws.

Judge Paul G. Rosenblatt granted the Commissions request and entered orders to recover and conserve assets for the benefit of victims of the scam, including an asset freeze, an accounting, the appointment of a receiver, an order preserving documents and an order for the repatriation of funds moved overseas.  The scheme began in 1997 and raised at least $1.4 million, and possibly as much as $25 million, from as many as 4,600 investors nationwide.  , In its action, the Commission named the following individuals:, In its complaint, the Commission alleges that by mailings and personal solicitations, Holt represented that International Funding and another entity, Cambridge Global Group, which later combined with International Funding, would pool funds received from investors for foreign investment, and generate anticipated returns of at least 5% to 7% per month, which equates to annual returns of 79.58% to 125% per year.  The foreign investments were supposed to involve Federal Reserve Notes and various for profit ventures, including trading in currency, commodities, precious metals and real estate.  Further, investors were assured that they could retrieve their funds 90 to 180 days after investment.  , According to the Commissions complaint, notwithstanding Holts assurances and representations, many International Funding investors have been unable to recover the principal they invested or their supposed profits, and Holt has refused to substantiate the use of investor funds or the location of investment assets. The Commissions investigation prior to filing suit found no evidence that Holt and International Funding had actually invested funds raised from investors or generated the represented returns; instead, Holt appears to have misapplied investor funds, including to purchase an expensive personal residence., The Commission also named in its complaint as relief defendants, seeking return of investor funds they unjustly received and/or company records, the following entities and individuals associated with Holt:, The Commission alleges in its complaint that Holt and International Funding violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition to seeking emergency relief against Holt and International Funding, the Commission is also seeking orders of permanent injunction, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties. The Commission is also seeking asset freezes and disgorgement from the relief defendants (with the exception of Alston), because they hold title to, or received proceeds from the sale of, assets allegedly acquired with investor funds.  The Commission is asking that Alston, who was associated with Holt and International Funding, be ordered to preserve the records of International Funding., The Commission acknowledges the assistance and of cooperation the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission, which simultaneously commenced a civil lawsuit against Holt and International Funding, and also of the U.S. Attorneys Office for Arizona, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Securities Division of the Arizona Corporation Commission.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18356.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Berger, the former president, chief executive officer, and chairman of the board of directors of Craig Consumer Electronics, Inc., was found guilty of twelve felony counts, including conspiracy, bank fraud, falsifying corporate books and records, and making false statements in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Craig sold consumer electronics to retailers such as Best Buy and Circuit City, and was based in Cerritos, California., A federal grand jury indictment alleged that in 1996 and 1997, Berger fraudulently enabled Craig to borrow significantly more from its line of credit than was allowed under the terms of its credit agreement with a consortium of four banks.  The indictment further  alleged that Berger fraudulently overstated Craigs inventory and accounts receivable.  Craigs reported inventory and accounts receivable established the amount of Craigs borrowing availability from the bank.  By fraudulently transferring defective inventory to a refurbished inventory category, and by overstating Craigs accounts receivable through the creation of bogus shipments and by shipping product early, Berger defrauded the bank into loaning Craig more than allowable under Craigs borrowing agreement.  The bank consortium ultimately lost approximately $8 million and many investors lost their entire investment in the company., The jury deadlocked on other counts against Berger and on counts against Bonnie K. Metz, Bergers co-defendant and Craigs former vice president of international sales.  Donna Richardson, Craigs former chief financial officer, earlier pled guilty to three criminal counts of bank fraud.  Sentencing for both Berger and Richardson is pending., Previously, on September 27, 2000, the Commission filed a civil complaint against Berger and Richardson in federal district court in Los Angeles for misleading investors through false disclosure and financial reporting in filings with the Commission.  Simultaneous with the filing of the complaint, Berger consented to the issuance of a permanent injunction, without admitting or denying the allegations contained in the Commissions complaint, agreed to pay a civil penalty, and be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  See <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr16731.htm>Litigation Release No. 16731</a> (Sept. 27, 2000).

See <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17100.htm>Litigation Release No. 17100</a> (Aug. 13, 2001).

Miller, both of whom are former officers of PurchasePro.com, Inc., a Las Vegas-based internet company now known as Pro-After, Inc.  Both Anderson and Miller settled the charges without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations., The Commissions complaint against Anderson alleges that from October 2000 through April 2001, while he was PurchasePros Senior Vice President of Sales and Strategic Development, Anderson knowingly or recklessly participated in a series of acts and transactions designed to inflate PurchasePros revenues in contravention of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  In particular, the complaint alleges, Anderson negotiated or otherwise had reason to know about side agreements with several customers that induced them to buy marketplace licenses from PurchasePro during both the fourth quarter of PurchasePros 2000 fiscal year (Q4 2000) and the first quarter of its 2001 fiscal year (Q1 2001), thereby materially inflating PurchasePros publicly announced and reported revenues for those quarters.  According to the complaint, Anderson also concealed these side agreements from PurchasePros auditors, and falsely represented to PurchasePros auditors that there were no such side agreements.  , The complaint further charges that Anderson knowingly falsified PurchasePros accounting books and records and thereby caused PurchasePro to overstate the amount of revenue that was referred to it by its most important strategic partner, America Online, Inc., and that he directed a subordinate to create an inaccurate spreadsheet as support for the inflated AOL referrals.  Next, the complaint alleges that, during Q1 2001, Anderson participated in PurchasePros improper recognition of $3.7 million in revenue from a purported agreement with AOL called a Statement of Work, which Anderson knew or was reckless in not knowing was improper because, among other things, the parties never reached an agreement with respect to the services at issue and because the services were not performed as stated in the agreement.  Finally, the complaint alleges that, during April 2001, Anderson received a $100,000 retention bonus from PurchasePro and requested that his e-mail messages relating to the first week of that month be deleted. , In its complaint against Miller, the Commission alleged that Miller, while serving as PurchasePros Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Accounting Officer, knew or was reckless in not knowing that PurchasePros recognition of revenue from the Statement of Work agreement with AOL was improper under GAAP.  The complaint further alleges that Miller misled the companys outside auditors in connection with the auditors review of PurchasePros financial statements for Q1 2001 by, among other things, failing to provide the auditors with material facts that called into question the authenticity and performance of the Statement of Work.  In addition, the complaint charges Miller with knowingly circumventing PurchasePros internal accounting controls by, among other things, recording revenue from the Statement of Work without adequate documentary support, signing blank checks for use by PurchasePros former chief executive officer, and causing PurchasePro to pay a higher bonus to the companys then senior vice-president of sales than the companys compensation committee had authorized.  According to the complaint, Miller himself received a $100,000 bonus during the same time frame.  Finally, the complaint alleges that in February 2003, after being served with an SEC subpoena requiring that he produce documents relevant to the matters described above, Miller withheld, destroyed, and attempted to destroy several documents and electronic files that were subject to the subpoena., Based on these factual allegations, the Commission charged both Anderson and Miller with violating Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-2.  The Commission also charged Anderson with violating Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 and with aiding and abetting PurchasePros violations of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Exchange Act Rule 13a-1.

The Information alleges that Marks, who at the time was Vertexs highest-ranking attorney,  learned on September 20, 2001 that Vertex planned to announce the suspension of clinical trials of one of its promising drugs on September 24.  According to the Information, on September 21, Marks liquidated all of his Vertex stock despite having previously acknowledged in writing that the impending release would not be viewed favorably by Wall Street and that he should not sell his Vertex shares., According to the Information, at the time he traded, Marks was the designated attorney for employees to contact regarding compliance with Vertexs employee securities trading policy.  In that capacity, the Information alleges, Marks wrote Vertexs CEO an email on September 20, advising him to make sure that an employee who had requested permission to trade had no knowledge of the impending press release.  According to the Information, Marks email went on to say:  , . . .  I guess I am troubled about any employee trading prior to that release because it is likely to have an effect on the stock (looks like I cant sell any shares) and, depending on the degree of that effect, could create the perception of insider trading. . .   . , The Information alleges that, on September 21, less than 24 hours after writing this email to the CEO, Marks sold 20,900 shares of Vertex at an average price of $22.81 per share, receiving $476,765.

Sebastian, the former chief financial officer of L90, Inc., a former internet advertising firm now known as MaxWorldwide, Inc.  The civil and criminal actions allege that Sebastian participated in a scheme to generate fraudulent revenues through advertising barter transactions with other Internet companies in order to meet securities analysts revenue estimates., At the time of the offenses, L90 was based in Santa Monica and Marina del Rey, California, and its stock was traded on the NASDAQ National Market System., According to the allegations in the Commissions complaint and the criminal complaint, L90, through its subsidiary webMillion.com, engaged in a series of advertising barter transactions with other Internet companies, swapped checks with those companies for the purported value of the bartered advertising, and fraudulently recorded those amounts as revenue without disclosing that they resulted from barter transactions.  Frequently, L90 inserted a sham third party into the check swap in order to hide the true nature of the barter transaction from its auditors and the investing public.  Sebastian concealed the use of the third party from L90s auditor and made false representations to the auditor about L90s financial statements.  He also signed L90s Form 10-K and Forms 10-Q that were filed with the Commission containing false and misleading financial information.  Furthermore, Sebastian made false and misleading statements concerning L90s revenue numbers on quarterly conference calls with analysts and investors., Through the fraudulent barter transactions, L90 overstated its revenues in the third quarter of 2000 through the third quarter of 2001 by at least $4.3 million, or 7.9 percent overall, and by as much as 29 percent in one quarter.  As a result, L90 was able to meet analysts revenue estimates in all but one of these quarters., Sebastian, a 39-year-old resident of Virginia, was L90s CFO from July 1999 until he was placed on administrative leave on March 10, 2002.  He resigned on March 19, 2002., The criminal complaint, which was filed September 24, 2003, in United States District Court in Los Angeles, charges Sebastian with conspiring to commit securities fraud, a charge that carries a maximum of five years imprisonment.  Sebastian will be summoned to appear in federal court in Los Angeles on October 21., The Commissions complaint, which was filed September 25, 2003, in United States District Court in Los Angeles, alleges that Sebastian violated or aided and abetted violations of numerous provisions of the federal securities laws, including the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; the reporting provisions of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder; the record-keeping provisions of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1; the internal control provisions of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act; and the lying to the auditors provisions of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2.  The Commission is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains, a civil penalty, and an order barring Sebastian from serving as an officer or director of a public company., The Commission and the United States Attorneys Office previously charged three former L90 officers for their involvement in the fraudulent barter scheme.

Desjardins, Robert S. Zaba, Alnoor Jiwan, Ronald D. Brouillette and Brian A. Koehn engaged in a fraudulent scheme to sell the stock of Pay Pop, Inc. (Pay Pop), a now defunct telecommunications company.  The scheme included creating purportedly free trading Pay Pop stock (<i>i.e., </i>legend-free stock certificates that created the false impression that the stock complied with U.S. registration requirements), issuing a series of materially false and misleading public statements and selling Pay Pop shares to unsuspecting investors.  , The Commissions Complaint alleges that purportedly free trading Pay Pop stock was secured through a series of bribes paid to Jiwan, who was a senior manager of Pay Pops transfer agent, CIBC Mellon Trust Company (CIBC Mellon).  In exchange for the bribes, the Complaint alleges, CIBC Mellon issued Pay Pop stock certificates free of any restrictive legends, without requiring proof that the Pay Pop shares were subject to a registration statement filed with the Commission or exempt from such registration.  The Complaint alleges that by the end of the fraudulent scheme, approximately 98 million Pay Pop shares were illegally issued and distributed to the public.    , The Commissions Complaint also alleges that defendants Desjardins and Zaba made a series of material misrepresentations and omissions regarding Pay Pop to create continued demand for Pay Pop stock.  As alleged in the Complaint, at Desjardins and Zabas direction, Pay Pop issued a series of press releases that falsely reported multi-million dollar investment bank financings that did not exist, the purchase and sale of valuable Caribbean beach resort property that never occurred, the growth in Pay Pops client base and revenue in the face of business decline, the signing of material contracts that never existed, and the successful expansion into new business territories that were either never pursued or recently abandoned.  As further alleged in the Complaint, Koehn, who was not an accountant, created fictitious audited financial statements that grossly inflated Pay Pops assets.    , The Complaint alleges that Brouillette sold Pay Pop stock for the benefit of Desjardins and Zaba.  According to the Complaint, Brouillette did this through, among other things, trading of Pay Pop stock through a series of nominee accounts, systematic unauthorized trading in his customers accounts and knowingly making various false and misleading statements to his customers about Pay Pops business prospects.  After being terminated by his brokerage firm and being barred from acting as a registered representative by NASD, the Complaint alleges that Brouillette continued to act as an unregistered securities broker.  , As a result of the scheme, the Complaint alleges that Zaba and Desjardins made over $3 million (U.S.) from the sale of Pay Pop stock.  Pay Pop received none of the proceeds from the fraudulent stock sales and ultimately its stock became worthless.  , The Commissions Complaint alleges that the defendants violated Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Complaint further alleges that Jiwan aided and abetted the defendants violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and that Brouillette also violated Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act.  The Complaint seeks, with respect to each defendant, permanent injunctions, accountings, disgorgement, prejudgment interest, civil penalties and penny stock bars.

Sept. 25, 2003) (PLF), SEC SUES ATTORNEY FOR INSIDER TRADING, On September 25, 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a settled civil action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging that defendant Warren J. Soloski, a California attorney, traded on material nonpublic information that he obtained while representing Pay Pop, Inc. (Pay Pop), a now defunct British Columbia-based telecommunications company.  The Complaint alleges that Soloski violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws (Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder).  The Commission also issued an administrative order finding that Soloski violated the same provisions.   , In both its federal court Complaint and its cease-and-desist order, the Commission charged that Soloski received a proposed term sheet from an investment banking firm for a potential $8 million equity financing of Pay Pop.  On the same day Soloski received the draft term sheet, he purchased 10,000 shares of Pay Pop.  The Commission further charged that Soloski sold these shares after learning the financing would not close due to the issuance of at least 15 million Pay Pop shares via stock certificates that were free of any restrictive legends in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act.    , According to the Commission, Soloski sold his Pay Pop stock while in possession of the following material nonpublic information that he obtained through his representation of the company:  (i) Pay Pop had 19 million shares issued and outstanding, approximately 15 million of which Soloski knew to be illegally issued; and (ii) Pay Pop failed to close the $8 million financing despite the fact that Pay Pop had issued a false press release on June 28, 1999 stating that it had closed on the financing.  As a result of Soloskis sale of Pay Pop stock, he avoided losses of $922.14.    , Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations and findings, Soloski has consented to the entry of a final judgment requiring him to pay disgorgement of $922.14, prejudgment interest of $288.83 thereon, and a one-time civil penalty of $922.14.  In addition, Soloski has consented to the entry of an order requiring him to cease and desist from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  <i>In the Matter of Warren J.

FINK<br/>(United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, 03-MBD-10291 (RWZ)), The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that, on September 25, 2003, it filed an action in Massachusetts federal court to enforce a subpoena against Jonathan G. Fink, of Beverly Hills, California.  The Commissions Application alleges that, on June 2, 2003, the Commission served Fink with a subpoena requiring him to appear for testimony on July 1, 2003.  At Finks request, the Commission staff rescheduled Finks testimony for July 16, 2003.  Fink appeared for testimony on July 16; however, his testimony was not completed that day.  As a result, Fink and Commission staff agreed to reconvene his testimony on August 28 and 29.  Fink never appeared for testimony on those dates, claiming that he was ill.  As of the date of the Commissions filing, Fink had not responded to the staffs requests that he provide documentary evidence concerning his purported illness, nor had he proposed new alternative dates for reconvening his testimony., In its Application, the Commission alleges that, on April 15, 2003, the Commission issued a formal order of private investigation entitled <u>In the Matter of Converge Global, Inc</u>.  Pursuant to the formal order, Commission staff began investigating a possible stock manipulation scheme related to Converge Global, Inc., a Florida-based holding company that purports to sell telecommunications products through TeleWrx, Inc., its sole operating subsidiary.  Between at least March and June 2002, Converge and others disseminated spam e-mails and press releases projecting the explosive growth and success of TeleWrxs network marketing program.  Among other things, Converges trading volume increased 443%, on the day following issuance of one of the press releases.  On June 26, 2002, Fink admitted, during a telephone interview with Commission staff, that he helped to draft at least some of Converges press releases.  Fink is also a purported consultant to Converge and, as such, appears to have received, and distributed, a significant amount of Converge shares during the period at issue.  The Commission alleges in the Application that it requires the continuation of Finks testimony to determine his potential role with respect to the Converge press releases and the potential manipulation scheme related to trading in Converge common stock between at least March and June 2002. , Pursuant to its Application, the Commission is seeking an order directing Fink to show cause why he should not comply with the Commissions subpoena and/or an order compelling Fink to appear for testimony.  The Commissions action has been assigned to the Honorable Rya W. Zobel, District Court Judge. , <!--<P><IMG SRC=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=9 ALT= BORDER=0>  <A href=/litigation/complaints/comp18369.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</A></P>--><!-- End text -->,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18369.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

James C. Horne</i> (United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Civ. No. 00-C-5935), The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that, on September 12, 2003,  an Illinois federal court entered, by consent, an order permanently enjoining defendant James C. Horne, of Lake Bluff, Illinois, from future violations of the antifraud, periodic reporting, books and records and internal accounting controls provisions of the federal securities laws.  The order also holds Horne liable for disgorgement and interest totaling almost $100,000, but waives payment of all but $20,000, and does not impose a penalty, based on Hornes sworn representations and other documents submitted concerning his financial condition.  At the time of the conduct at issue, Horne was the president of OakGrigsby, Inc., a Sugar Grove, Illinois company that was a division of Oak Industries, Inc., headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts., The Commissions complaint, filed on September 27, 2000, alleged that, between July 1995 and January 1997, defendants Horne and Matthew R. Welch, the former controller of OakGrigsby, conspired to fraudulently conceal OakGrigsbys operating expenses such as salaries, shipping and travel.  OakGrigsbys results were consolidated with those of other Oak divisions and incorporated into Oaks periodic Commission filings and press releases.  As a result of Horne and Welchs actions, Oaks income per share for the fourth quarter of 1995 and for the first three quarters of 1996 were materially overstated.  According to the Complaint, the defendants were, at least in part, motivated to undertake the scheme in order to ensure that OakGrigsby met specified earnings targets, which allowed Horne to earn a bonus of $55,000 for 1995.  The disgorgement ordered by the Court was of Hornes 1995 bonus. Welch has previously settled the Commissions action., The Commissions complaint charged Horne with, and the Court permanently enjoined Horne from, violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder (antifraud provisions), Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 (prohibiting falsification of issuer books and records), and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder (issuer reporting, books and records and internal accounting controls provisions). The order, entered by the Honorable Ronald A. Guzmàn, held Horne liable for disgorgement of $55,000, plus prejudgment interest of $39,574, or a total of $94,574, but waived payment of all but $20,000 based on Hornes financial condition.

Sport-Haley, located in Denver, Colorado, designs, markets, and contracts for the manufacture of golf apparel and outerwear under the Haley-Registered Trademark label.  According to the Complaint, Sport-Haley materially misstated inventory, improperly capitalized period costs and materially misstated losses on the sale of headwear equipment in its quarterly and annual 1998, 1999, and 2000 financial statements., Named as defendants in the Complaint are Sport-Haley, R.G. Tomlinson of Scottsdale, Arizona, the current chairman and former chief executive officer, and Steve S. Auger of Morrison, Colorado, the former controller of Sport-Haley.  , The Commission asserts that Sport-Haley materially overstated inventory in its financial statements during its 1998 and 1999 fiscal years.  According to the Complaint, Tomlinson and Auger knowingly concealed that inventory was materially overstated by $1.2 million at June 30, 1999 and agreed to eliminate the overstated inventory by writing the inventory off at the rate of $100,000 per month during its 2000 fiscal year.  The Commission alleges Sport-Haley failed to disclose the inventory overstatement or the companys elaborate measures to adjust the financial statements for the overstatement.  The Complaint asserts that Sport-Haley materially understated expenses related to period costs in financial statements filed with the Commission during its 1998 and 1999 fiscal years and first three quarters of 2000.  The Commission also alleges that Tomlinson and Auger knowingly or recklessly allowed the company to materially misstate losses on the sale of headwear equipment in Sport-Haleys 1999 year-end financial statements and quarterly financial statements during the first three quarters of its 2000 fiscal year.  The Complaint asserts that Tomlinson and Auger reviewed and signed filings with the Commission that they knew or were reckless in not knowing contained false financial statements.  , According to the Complaint,<b><i> </i></b>as a result of these and other accounting errors, Sport-Haley filed with the Commission materially incorrect financial statements that overstated the companys 1998 fiscal year income by $1.5 million or 41 percent and its 1999 fiscal year income by $311,000 or 22 percent., As a result of the conduct described in the Complaint, the Commission charged Sport-Haley, Tomlinson, and Auger with violations of Sections 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) (antifraud provisions).

The orders require Vivendi to escrow any extraordinary payments that it might otherwise make to Messier and they temporarily enjoin any efforts that seek to execute on a judgment regarding the $23 million that Messier obtained in New York State Court.  The orders are the result of an application that the SEC made on September 16, 2003 for an escrow order pursuant to Section 1103 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and an emergency motion that the SEC filed on September 23, 2003 to halt Messiers efforts to collect on the state court judgment., Section 1103 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act authorizes the Commission to seek such a temporary order during an investigation into possible securities laws violations by a public company, or an officer, director, or other affiliate of a public company.  Pursuant to the temporary order, the public company must escrow extraordinary payments that the public company likely may make to an officer, director, or affiliate. , The SECs staff has been investigating possible violations of the federal securities laws by Vivendi and its directors, officers, partners, controlling persons, agents, or employees pursuant to a formal order of private investigation issued by the Commission on November 14, 2002.  The SEC filed the Section 1103 application after Messier obtained a judgment in New York State Court on September 11, 2003 enforcing an arbitration panels decision ordering Vivendi to pay Messier €20,555,342 (or approximately $23 million) pursuant to a termination agreement with Vivendi.  , After the SEC filed its application for a Section 1103 order, Messier began efforts to collect on the state court judgment.  After negotiations between the SEC, Vivendi and Messier to reach an agreement to postpone any further collection efforts failed, the SEC filed a motion on September 23, 2003 seeking an order (1) prohibiting Vivendi and others (including banks) from transferring any assets to Messier, and (2) prohibiting efforts to collect on the state judgment.  At a hearing on September 24, 2003, the Court granted both the SECs application for a Section 1103 order and the SECs motion prohibiting further efforts to execute on or otherwise collect under the state court judgment.  The Section 1103 order requires Vivendi to place the approximately €20 million in escrow, and will last for 45 days.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18373.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Pfau, a resident of Evergreen, Colorado and former employee of Qwest Communications International, Inc. (Qwest).  In addition, the Commission filed a related action for civil penalties against Pfau in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado.  , In the Order, <i>In the Matter of Loren D. Pfau</i> [<a href=/litigation/admin/33-8295.htm>33-8295</a>], the Commission found that in the final days of each quarter from December 2000 through June 2001, Qwest used Indefeasible Right of Use (IRU) agreements to sell fiber-optic cable from its telecommunications network as a means to meet aggressive revenue targets.  An IRU is an irrevocable right to use a specific amount of fiber for a specified time period.  Qwest accounted for IRUs as sales-type leases and recognized nearly the entire amount of the IRU revenue up-front at the time of contract execution, rather than over the life of the IRU agreement.  Qwest employees and management commonly referred to IRU sales as gap fillers, in other words, a means to make up the shortfall between the aggressive revenue projections as publicly announced by Qwest and the actual revenue earned.  , Specifically, the Commission found that in three IRU transactions executed between December 2000 and June 2001, Pfau, then a Qwest sales manager, along with Qwest senior management, provided secret side agreements allowing the purchasers of fiber-optic cable to exchange (or port) the fiber purchased for different fiber at a later date.  The explicit purpose of making the side agreements secret was to conceal from Qwests accountants and outside auditors the purchasers ability to port, since such exchange rights would have defeated, under generally accepted accounting principles, the up-front revenue recognition sought by Qwest.  According to the Commissions findings, Qwest improperly recognized from the three IRU transactions $26.6 million of revenue in the first and second quarters of 2001.  As a result, Qwests quarterly reports for the first and second quarters of 2001, and its annual report for 2001, contained materially false information.  , Without admitting or denying the findings in the Commissions Order, Pfau has agreed to settle the Commissions claims by consenting to the entry of an administrative order requiring him to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and from causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  , The Commissions complaint in the district court action alleges the same conduct referenced above, and Pfau, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, has consented to the entry of judgment by the U.S. District Court requiring him to pay a civil penalty of $25,000.  In settling for a $25,000 penalty, the Commission considered Pfaus cooperation in connection with the Commissions ongoing investigation of this matter,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18374.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

(Wellness), a former investment adviser and its sole principal, Jesse Dean Bogdonoff (Bogdonoff) for defrauding the Tonga Trust Fund (Trust), a trust fund established by the government of Tonga.  The SECs complaint alleges that from June 1999 to November 2001, Wellness and Bogdonoff fraudulently induced the Trust to invest $24.5 million in three highly speculative and unsuitable investments.  As a result of the fraud, the Trust has lost substantially all of its investment.  The adviser received at least $2 million in commissions from the companies whose securities he recommended, as well as $540,000 in advisory fees from the Trust., According to the complaint, Bogdonoff recommended that the Trust invest $20 million with a newly established company that sold investments in viatical contracts, which are agreements to purchase the benefits of life insurance policies insuring terminally ill or very elderly persons.  Bogdonoff falsely told the trustees that this investment carried no market risk, despite the risk that the Trust could lose all of its investment held by the thinly capitalized company.  The complaint also alleged that Bogdonoff recommended that the Trust invest $4 million dollars and $500,000, respectively, in two private companies that Bogdonoff knew were struggling to stay solvent.  The complaint further alleges that Bogdonoff falsely reported to the trustees on several occasions that all three investments were increasing in value, when in fact, the investments were failing or stagnant., The SECs complaint alleged that by November 2001, the investments collapsed or defaulted without returning any of the Trusts investment funds., The complaint charges Wellness with violating Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act) and Bogdonoff with aiding and abetting those violations; it also charges Wellness and Bogdonoff with violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission seeks a court order directing Wellness and Bogdonoff to disgorge all commissions and fees they received relating to the Trusts investments, imposing civil monetary penalties and enjoining them from future violations of the securities laws. , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18375.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18375.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Ruhl</i>, Civil Action No. 03-CV-7559 (S.D.N.Y.)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced the filing, on September 25, 2003, of a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging insider trading in the securities of Conestoga Enterprises, Inc. (Conestoga) by defendant John R. Felder, of Naples, Florida.  Felder purchased Conestogas stock in advance of a July 25, 2001 announcement of a merger between Conestoga and NTELOS, Inc. (NTELOS) after receiving material, nonpublic information concerning the proposed merger from defendant Jean M. Ruhl, of Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, a member of Conestogas Board of Directors.  The complaint seeks permanent injunctions for violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, disgorgement, civil penalties, and an officer and director bar against Ruhl.  As described below, the defendants have agreed to settle this matter., Conestoga was an integrated communications provider based in Birdsboro, Pennsylvania.  Its stock was traded on the NASDAQ national market., The Commissions complaint alleges that on the morning of July 25, 2001, Conestoga publicly announced that it had signed an agreement to merge with NTELOS.  Under the terms of the agreement, Conestoga shareholders would receive approximately $40 per share in a combination of cash and stock.  This merger was never consummated.  In September 2001, Conestoga opted to accept a more favorable offer from another company, D&amp;E Communications, Inc.  Following the announcement, Conestogas share price increased $5.25, or 16.5 percent, from $31.75 (at the close on July 24) to $37., The complaint alleges that Felder knew Ruhl socially and professionally, knew that she was a member of Conestogas Board, and spoke with her often during the time of the merger negotiations.  In the months leading up to Felders trading, he and Ruhl spoke often by telephone, including the days surrounding each Board meeting and each of Felders purchases of Conestoga stock.  During at least some of these calls, Felder sought information from Ruhl concerning whether Conestoga was seeking a merger.  In breach of her fiduciary duties to Conestoga and its shareholders, Ruhl conveyed material, nonpublic information concerning the proposed merger to Felder.  On six separate days between July 2 and July 18, 2001, just prior to the announcement of the merger, Felder then purchased a total of 9,200 shares of Conestoga common stock, spending almost $272,000.  Although Felder did not sell his shares on July 25, 2001, he had potential profits of $68,476 from his unlawful trading. , Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint, and without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a Final Judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; ordering Felder and Ruhl to jointly and severally pay disgorgement in the amount of $68,476, together with prejudgment interest; and ordering the defendants to each pay a civil penalty in the amount of $68,476.  In addition, Ruhl will be barred from acting as an officer or director of a public company., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of NASD Regulation, Inc. in this matter., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18376.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18376.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Commission alleges, specifically, that Long misled investors by stating, falsely, that ACIs trading programs were paying weekly returns of up to 45 percent and that investors were guaranteed return of their principal plus 6½ percent at the end of the programs 13-month term.  None of the investors funds were invested as promised; rather, Long used the funds to make Ponzi payments couched as trading profits and misappropriated most of the remaining funds.

Texas, Dallas Division).</h2>]","[On September 30, 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit against 2DoTrade, Inc., its president, several recidivist stock promoters, and two attorneys in a pump-and-dump market-manipulation case.  2DoTrade is an SEC-reporting company whose stock was formerly quoted publicly on the OTC Bulletin Board.  According to the SECs complaint, from July to November 2001, the defendants engaged in a fraudulent scheme in which they artificially pumped 2DoTrades stock with false press releases, spam e-mail, and a fraudulent website and then illegally dumped millions of shares into the inflated market.  At one point in the scheme-amid recurring reports of fatal anthrax attacks in the United States-several of the defendants sought to profit from the nations fear of terrorism with false press releases about 2DoTrades purported imminent distribution of an anti-anthrax compound in the United States.  In a separate civil lawsuit filed on the same day, the SEC alleged securities fraud and other violations against a California attorney and accountant who created and sold the public shell company used in the 2DoTrade scheme., The 2DoTrade complaint alleges that, in June 2001, defendants Barry W. Gewin, 36, of Enon Valley, Pennsylvania, Eric T. Landis, 38, of Charlottesville, Virginia, and Dominic Roelandt, 26, of Dehderhoutem, Belgium, gained <i>de facto</i> control of 2DoTrade-a shell company with no assets or revenue-by acquiring control over virtually all of its free-trading stock.  Then, in collusion with 2DoTrades president, defendant George R. Taylor of Ayrshire, Scotland, they manipulated 2DoTrades stock price in two fraudulent promotional campaigns.  The first campaign, which took place in July and August 2001, touted 2DoTrades ownership of certain import/export contracts supposedly worth $300 million.  In reality, these contracts were worthless.  The second campaign, which began in October 2001, claimed that 2DoTrade was testing an anti-anthrax compound called ATHOQ at a hospital and a university in the United Kingdom for imminent distribution in the United States.  In reality, ATHOQ was a sham, and no anthrax testing or product distribution ever occurred., During the bogus-contract campaign, the defendants dumped millions of shares into the market, collectively realizing approximately $1.6 million in trading profits.  As the defendants sold their shares, the share price gradually declined by the end of August 2001.  Beginning on October 31, 2001, however, the bogus anti-anthrax campaign drove up 2DoTrades stock price again, this time by approximately 400%.  During this period, certain defendants dumped over 700,000 shares into the market, for which they collectively received approximately $240,000.  An SEC trading suspension on November 6, 2001, halted trading in 2DoTrades stock and prevented some of the defendants from dumping millions of additional shares., Other defendants named in the SECs 2DoTrade complaint are:, Several of the 2DoTrade defendants have prior disciplinary histories.  In 1992, Taylor was convicted in the United Kingdom of conspiracy to commit theft.  Roelandt was enjoined in August 2000 by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Arizona for securities fraud in an action bought by the SEC, and in 2001, in another unrelated SEC action, he received an administrative penny-stock bar from the SEC.  In 1999, the NASD suspended Landis brokerage license for one year and fined him for market manipulation.  And in 1998, Wood was the subject of an SEC cease-and-desist order for violations of the anti-touting provisions of the federal securities laws.  , The Commissions complaint alleges that defendant 2DoTrade violated the securities-registration, anti-fraud, and issuer-reporting provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically, sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder.  It alleges that defendant Taylor violated the anti-fraud provisions and aided and abetted 2DoTrades violations of the issuer reporting provisions.  It alleges that defendants Gewin, Roelandt, and Landis, and the defendant companies they controlled, violated the securities-registration and anti-fraud provisions and also the beneficial-ownership and principal-shareholder reporting provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically, sections 13(d) and 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13d-1, 16a-2, and 16a-3 thereunder.  And it alleges that defendants, Karsch, Stillman, Wood, and Walker, and the defendant companies under their control, violated the securities-registration and anti-fraud provisions and that Stillman also aided and abetted 2DoTrades violations of the issuer reporting provisions of the federal securities laws. , The SEC seeks, among other relief, permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with pre-judgment interest, and civil money penalties against all the defendants; officer-and-director bars against Taylor, Gewin, Roelandt, and Wood; penny-stock bars against Taylor, Gewin, Roelandt, Wood, Walker, and Karsch; and an order enjoining Roelandt from violating section 15(b)(6)(B) of the Exchange Act, which prohibits participation in a penny-stock offering in contravention of an SEC order., <b>The Fraudulent Shell Factory</b>, Also on September 30, 2003, the SEC filed a related lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas against Craig J. Shaber, 45, a California-licensed attorney and Stephen R. Wright, 57, an accountant, both from the San Diego, California area.  According to the complaint, from 1998 to 2002, Shaber and Wright engaged in an elaborate scheme to manufacture and sell 18 public shell companies, from which they derived at least $7.5 million in ill-gotten gains.  To carry out the shell factory scheme, Shaber and Wright installed nominee officers and directors in dormant corporations that they controlled and caused these companies to submit false registration statements and reports to the SEC and the NASD, Inc.  These false documents gave the bogus companies the appearance of legitimacy and permitted their securities to be eligible for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board.  , Among other things, the false registration statements and reports contained phony business plans, misrepresented the identity of the companies true officers and directors, and contained false shareholder lists.  In reality, Shaber and Wright owned virtually all of the companies stock, and the individual shareholders listed in the documents were merely nominees for Shaber and Wright.  In addition, Shaber and Wright served as the <i>de facto</i> officers and directors of the companies and intended not to pursue the stated business plans, but rather, to sell their controlling blocks of shares-and thus control of the shell companies-to stock promoters and other buyers for substantial profits.  Shaber and Wright sold one of these fraudulently manufactured companies, Moranzo, Inc., for approximately $600,000 to certain 2DoTrade defendants, who then used it to create 2DoTrade and carry out that scheme.  , The other defendant and relief defendants in the Shaber and Wright case are:, The complaint alleges that Shaber, Wright, and Bonaventure Capital violated the securities-registration, anti-fraud, beneficial-ownership, and principal-shareholder reporting provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically, sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act and sections 10(b), 13(d), and 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13d-1, 16a-2, and 16a-3 thereunder.  It further alleges that they aided and abetted violations of the issuer-reporting provisions, specifically, sections 13(a) of Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.  The SEC seeks disgorgement with prejudgment interest from each defendant and relief defendant and further seeks permanent injunctions, an accounting, and officer-and-director bars against defendants Shaber and Wright., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority, the British Columbia Securities Commission, the Police Department of Tayside, Scotland, the London Metropolitan Police Department, the Hampshire Constabulary in England, the FBIs Dallas Field Office, and the United States Department of Justice in the investigation of this matter., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18381.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18381a.htm>Second SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18381.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

(CorrPro Australia), falsified the accounting records of the subsidiary, CorrPro Australia, in order to inflate its net income and its net assets.  The complaint seeks injunctive relief against Waring and Treloar as well as the imposition of an officer and director bar., The complaint alleges that Waring and Treloar falsified CorrPro Australias financial records so that CorrPro Australia would meet financial performance targets set by managers at the parent company.  The complaint alleges that as a result, CorrPro misstated its financial statements after incorporating the false numbers from CorrPro Australia., The complaint alleges that beginning in at least October 2000, Waring, and Treloar at Warings direction, began entering journal entries to CorrPro Australias general ledger that increased profit and net assets.  The complaint also alleges that Waring and Treloar falsified invoices and credit notes, and made false entries to subledgers including accounts payable, accounts receivable, costs of goods sold and inventory, and falsified reporting packages sent to CorrPro.  The complaint further alleges that Treloar and Waring recorded fictitious invoices in CorrPros computerized accounting records and later printed physical copies of the false invoices.  In addition, the complaint alleges that they falsified credit notes from suppliers, and accordingly, the accounts payable ledger, to make it look like CorrPro Australia owed less money than it did., The complaint goes on to allege that Waring and Treloar took steps to fabricate documents to be reviewed by the companys independent auditors.  The complaint further alleges that in November 2001 before an expected audit, Treloar e-mailed Waring two versions of a spreadsheet summarizing monthly results from April 2001 through September 2001.  The complaint alleges that in order to ensure that the auditors would review general ledger balances that matched those previously sent to CorrPro, Waring recorded false entries to the general ledger to increase profit in each month., The Commissions complaint alleges that Waring and Treloar committed fraud in connection with the purchase and sale of securities, in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Lloyd (the owner of a registered broker-dealer), and four other relatives or employees of the Andlingers, bought more than $2.8 million in NetOptix stock between January 21 and January 24, 2000.  , According to the complaint, the purchase of these NetOptix shares came just one week after some of the defendants sold most or all of their NetOptix holdings (which they had purchased in 1998, 1999 or early 2000).  The Commissions complaint alleges that Donner, Dailey and Lloyd sold their NetOptix stock after Andlinger expressed the opinion that NetOptixs stock was over-valued.  , Corning publicly announced on February 14, 2000 that it would acquire NetOptix.  Although only one of the traders sold their stock at that time, and most have continued to hold their stock (which is now Corning stock), the Commissions complaint alleges that the value of the NetOptix shares by Jeanne Andlinger, Donner, Dailey, Lloyd and others that they tipped increased by more than $1.8 million as a result of that announcement.  , Andlinger, Jeanne Andlinger, Donner and Dailey, all of Vero Beach, Florida, and Lloyd, of New York, New York, have agreed to settle the charges against them, without admitting or denying the allegations contained in the Commissions complaint.  Under the terms of the settlement, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10-b5 thereunder.  The judgment also orders Jeanne Andlinger, Donner, Dailey and Lloyd to disgorge approximately $1.6 million in profits and imputed profits they earned from their trading, plus prejudgment interest, and orders Andlinger to disgorge approximately $59,000 in profits earned by others on the basis of information he provided.  The judgment also orders the defendants to pay a total of $1.8 million in civil money penalties.

Burkitt (F. Burkitt), of Arnold, Maryland.  F. Burkitt sold RMHT stock while in possession of material, nonpublic information concerning negative financial news to be announced by RMHT, which he had received from defendant Paul Burkitt (P. Burkitt), of Wayne, Pennsylvania, his son and an officer of RMHT.  The complaint seeks permanent injunctions for violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, disgorgement and civil penalties.  As described below, the defendants have agreed to settle this matter., RMHT, headquartered in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, provides customer relationship management services for corporations in the technology, telecommunications, financial services, insurance, and other industries.  Its stock is traded on the NASDAQ National Market.  For fiscal year 2001, RMHT reported revenue of $174 million and a net loss of $17.6 million.  RMHTs fiscal year ends September 30th., The Commissions complaint alleges that on January 4, 2001, RMHT announced that it expected a loss for its first fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2000, and lowered revenue estimates for fiscal year 2001.  Following the announcement, the price of RMHT stock declined sharply, closing at $3.50 per share, down 50 percent from the previous days close of $7 per share., The complaint alleges that P. Burkitt was RMHTs Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing, and knew throughout the companys first quarter that its financial condition was deteriorating.  He also knew that RMHT was going to announce revised revenue and earnings estimates, and that his father owned RMHT stock.  In a telephone conversation on the evening of January 2, 2001, P. Burkitt tipped his father about RMHTs upcoming negative announcement.  On January 3, 2001, prior to RMHTs announcement, F. Burkitt sold 10,000 shares, his entire holdings of RMHT stock.

Morgan Securities Inc. (J.P. Morgan), a subsidiary of J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., relating to the firms allocation of stock to institutional customers in initial public offerings (IPOs) it underwrote during 1999 and 2000.  In settlement of this matter, J.P. Morgan has consented, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, to a final judgment that would permanently enjoin J.P. Morgan from violating Rule 101 of the Commissions Regulation M and NASD Conduct Rule 2110, and order it to pay a $25 million civil penalty.  The settlement terms are subject to approval by the court., In its complaint, the Commission alleges that J.P. Morgan violated Rule 101 of Regulation M under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by attempting to induce certain customers who received allocations of IPOs to place purchase orders for additional shares in the aftermarket.  The complaint further alleges that J.P. Morgan did in fact induce certain customers to place such orders and such customers often purchased stock during the new issues first few trading days., The Commissions complaint also alleges that, in another instance, J.P. Morgan violated NASD Conduct Rule 2110, which requires member firms to observe just and equitable principles of trade, by persuading one or more customers in July 1999, to accept an allocation of a cold IPO (<i>i.e.</i>, one where there is little interest in IPO shares) by promising the reward of an allocation of an upcoming oversubscribed IPO., The Commissions complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, includes the following allegations:, Rule 101 of Regulation M, among other things, prohibits underwriters, during a restricted period prior to the completion of their participation in the distribution of IPO shares, from directly or indirectly bidding for, purchasing, or attempting to induce any person to bid for or purchase any offered security in the aftermarket. As a prophylactic rule, Regulation M is designed to prohibit activities that could artificially influence the market for the offered security, including for example, supporting the IPO price by creating the perception of scarcity of IPO stock or creating the perception of aftermarket demand., During the restricted period, <i>i.e.</i>, prior to J.P. Morgans completion of participation in the distribution of IPO shares, J.P. Morgan attempted to induce certain customers to make aftermarket purchases in violation of Rule 101 of Regulation M by engaging in the following activities:, In addition to its violations of Rule 101 of Regulation M, J.P. Morgan violated NASD Conduct Rule 2110 by persuading one or more customers in July 1999, to accept an allocation of Biopure, a cold IPO, by promising the reward of an allocation of IPIX, an upcoming oversubscribed IPO.  J.P. Morgan had difficulties in generating sufficient interest for the Biopure IPO and therefore reduced the number of shares being offered, reduced the proposed price range and delayed the final pricing of the IPO.  On the evening of July 29, 1999, when the Biopure IPO was ultimately priced, but before J.P. Morgan told customers what their Biopure allocations would be, the head of syndicate noted in an e-mail:  IPIX allocations (very strong deal) will be heavily weighted toward those investors that participated in the Biopure offering . . . Given that we have fully allocated all accounts in the Biopure deal . . . it is extremely important that your investors take these allocations.

Cal.)]</h2>]","[The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) filed a civil complaint this morning in United States District Court in Los Angeles charging Paul Joseph Sheehan (Sheehan) with securities fraud and investment adviser fraud.  Sheehan allegedly carried out a fraudulent trade allocation scheme known as cherry-picking.  Separately from the Commissions action, Sheehan was arrested this morning by FBI agents on a charge of investment advisory fraud.  , The Commissions action and the criminal case allege that Sheehan fraudulently allocated profitable securities trades to his own personal accounts at the expense of his clients accounts.  From at least April 1999 until September 2000, Sheehan cherry-picked at least $7.4 million in profitable day trades for himself and thereby stole economic opportunities that rightfully belonged to his clients., Sheehan, 64, of West Hollywood, an investment adviser formerly registered with the Commission, operated Paul J. Sheehan &amp; Associates in West Hollywood until early 2003.  Sheehan provided investment management services to individuals, pension and profit-sharing plans, trusts, estates, charitable organizations, and corporations. , In the criminal complaint that was filed late yesterday, also in United States District Court in Los Angeles, Sheehan was charged with one count of fraud by an investment adviser.  These charges carry a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment and a fine of $250,000.  Sheehan is expected to make his initial court appearance this afternoon in federal court in Los Angeles., The Commissions civil complaint and the criminal complaint filed by the United States Attorneys Office allege that Sheehan implemented the fraudulent scheme by calling in trades to executing brokers without designating whether the trades were for his own personal accounts or the accounts of his clients.  After the trades were executed, the shares or trade proceeds were allocated to an account at Salomon Smith Barney.  Sheehan did not instruct Salomon Smith Barney to which particular client account or personal account the shares were to be allocated until the end of the trading day, by which time Sheehan knew whether or not a day trade had been profitable., According to an affidavit in support of the criminal complaint, Sheehans scheme was detected by a Commission accountant during an examination of Sheehans business.  The accountant found, among other things, a large disparity in profitability between Sheehans personal accounts and his clients accounts.  Subsequent statistical analysis by a Commission economist revealed that the chance the disparity was the result of random chance was less than one in ten quadrillion., Through this scheme, Sheehan knowingly and fraudulently allocated to his own personal accounts thousands of profitable day trades that that brought him profits of approximately $7.4 million.  In a required filing with the Commission, Sheehan falsely represented that he would give absolute priority to client accounts over any [Sheehan] account when there is accumulation or disposition of a security involving a client account and the [Sheehan] account.  , The Commissions complaint alleges that Sheehan violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The complaint seeks a permanent injunction prohibiting Sheehan from committing future violations of these laws and an order directing Sheehan to disgorge his ill-gotten gains and to pay a civil monetary penalty.  , Sheehan, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint, consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above provisions.  The appropriateness and amounts of disgorgement and civil penalty are to be determined by the court at a later date.  Sheehan also agreed to consent to the entry of a Commission administrative order revoking his registration with the Commission as an investment adviser and barring him from associating with any investment adviser., A criminal complaint contains allegations that a defendant has committed a crime.

Corder, age 61, of Zionsville, Indiana, Randal J. Sage, age 46, of Carmel, Indiana and Brian J. Yates, age 39, of Colorado Springs, Colorado, former officers of Analytical Surveys, Inc. (ASI), a Colorado corporation that provides computerized maps to customers under long-term contracts.  During the relevant time period, Corder was ASIs President, Chairman and CEO, Sage was ASIs Chief Operations Officer, and Yates was ASIs Controller.  , According to the complaint, Corder, Sage, and Yates engaged in a fraudulent scheme that caused ASIs 1999 fiscal year revenue and net earnings to be materially inflated in press releases and periodic reports filed with the SEC through the use of several improper accounting methods.  The SEC alleges that Sage caused ASI to improperly recognize revenue on long-term contracts by directing employees to: (1) finish contracts on indirect, where employees misallocated direct costs properly attributable to contracts to indirect, or overhead, accounts; (2) engage in cost-shifting, where employees improperly shifted future direct costs from one contract to another, when the work performed related to the first contract and did not reflect progress on the second contract; and (3) improperly lower estimates of total direct costs on certain contracts or not increase cost estimates as necessary.  All of these methods were impermissible under the percentage of completion method for recognizing revenue used by ASI.  Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) require that, under the percentage of completion method, estimated contract costs be periodically reviewed and revised to reflect accurate information.  The SEC further alleges that Corder: (1) knew or was reckless in not knowing that Sage and other employees had engaged in these fraudulent accounting practices; and (2) directed employees to, among other things, finish contracts on indirect to avoid reducing revenue.  Finally, the SEC alleges that Yates: (1) also knew or was reckless in not knowing about this conduct described above; and (2) approved or acquiesced in finishing contracts on indirect, including Corders direction to employees to finish contracts on indirect., The SEC alleges that defendants fraudulent conduct caused ASIs revenue and earnings to be materially overstated in ASIs 1999 Forms 10-Q by approximately: 5% and 60% for the 1st quarter; 7% and 89% for the 2nd quarter; and 5% and 51% for the 3rd quarter and in ASIs 1999 Form 10-K by 10% and 232%.  ASIs inflated revenue and earnings figures were also included in press releases issued to the public.  Thus, the SEC alleges that defendants violated the antifraud, periodic reporting, record keeping, internal controls and lying to the auditors provisions of the federal securities laws and seeks a Court order to permanently enjoin (1) defendants from violating Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder; and (2) Corder and Yates from violating Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder and Sage from aiding and abetting violations of these provisions.  The SEC also seeks an order against defendants imposing civil monetary penalties, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and bars from serving as officers and directors of any public company.  , In a related administrative proceeding, on September 26, 2003, the SEC ordered ASI to cease and desist from committing violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder (reporting, books and records and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws).

(January 29, 2003)</h2>, <h2>SEC SEEKS INJUNCTION, DISGORGEMENT AND PENALTIES</h2>]","[On October 3, 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed an amended complaint in the civil fraud injunctive action pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against KPMG LLP and four KPMG partners to include charges of fraud against an additional KPMG partner, Thomas J. Yoho, in connection with KPMGs audits of Xerox Corporation from 1997 through 2000.  The SEC seeks injunctions, disgorgement of all fees and civil money penalties against KPMG and the five KPMG partners named as defendants., The action was originally filed against KPMG and four of its partners on January 29, 2003.  As in the original complaint, the amended complaint alleges that KPMG and its partners permitted Xerox to manipulate its accounting practices to close a $3 billion gap between actual operating results and results reported to the investing public.  Year after year, the KPMG partners falsely represented to the public that their audits were conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS) and that Xeroxs financial reports fairly represented the companys financial condition and were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)., The Commissions amended complaint also repeats allegations that beginning at least as early as 1997, Xerox initiated or increased reliance on various accounting devices to manipulate its equipment revenues and earnings.  Most of these topside accounting devices violated GAAP and most improperly increased the amount of equipment revenue from leased office equipment products which Xerox recognized in its quarterly and annual financial statements filed with the Commission and distributed to investors and the public.  This improper revenue recognition had the effect of inflating equipment revenues and earnings beyond what actual operating results warranted.  In addition, the amended complaint alleges that the defendant KPMG partners fraudulently permitted Xerox to manipulate reserves to boost the companys earnings., Thomas J. Yoho, a resident of Greenwich, Connecticut and a certified public accountant, was the Concurring Review partner for KPMG on the Xerox audit from 1994 until after the 2000 audit was completed and KPMG was replaced as Xeroxs outside audit firm.  Among the responsibilities of the Concurring Review partner are to review key audit workpapers and audit reports and confer with the rest of the engagement team as necessary to give additional assurance that financial statements conform to accounting, reporting and regulatory requirements.  The amended complaint alleges that Yoho reviewed and evaluated the work of the KPMG audit team, and in that capacity, Yoho signed off on the Xerox audit teams audit despite his knowledge of Xeroxs fraudulent accounting practices.  Yoho signed audit workpapers year after year attesting that no matters had come to his attention that caused him to believe that the financial statements covered by the firms audit reports were not in conformity with GAAP.  He further attested that KPMGs audits of Xerox were performed in accordance with GAAS.,   However, the amended complaint alleges that from 1997 to 2001, Yoho learned that Xerox used a series of non-GAAP accounting practices and regularly made significant top-side accounting adjustments in order to compensate for poor operational performance., After this fraudulent conduct was investigated and exposed, Xerox, employing a new auditor, issued a $6.1 billion restatement of its equipment revenues and a $1.9 billion restatement of its pre-tax earnings for the years 1997 through 2000.  The Commissions amended complaint alleges that the KPMG partners fraudulent conduct allowed Xerox to inflate equipment revenues by approximately $3 billion and inflate pre-tax earnings by approximately $1.2 billion in the companys 1997 through 2000 financial results., The amended complaint alleges that Yoho violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 10A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and aided and abetted violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13a-1, 13a-13, 12b-20 and 13b2-1., On April 11, 2002, the Commission brought an injunctive action against Xerox based on the same allegations of accounting fraud as are alleged against the KPMG defendants, as well as other allegations.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Xerox consented to the entry of a Final Judgment that permanently enjoined the company from violating the antifraud, reporting and record keeping provisions of the federal securities laws.  Xerox also paid a $10 million civil penalty, agreed to restate its financial statements and agreed to hire a consultant to review the companys internal accounting controls and policies.  <i>Securities and Exchange Commission v.

Cal.)</h2>]","[The United States Securities and Exchange Commission announced today the filing of an action alleging a multi-million dollar securities fraud by a Santa Monica, Calif. investment adviser that for over three years deceived its clients and prospective clients by concealing a massive decline in the value of their assets, providing clients with false and misleading account statements, and taking over $1.2 million in undisclosed management fees., Named in the SECs complaint, filed on September 25, 2003 in United States District Court in Los Angeles, are National Financial Systems, Inc. (NFSI), an unregistered investment adviser that also acts as a third-party administrator for retirement plans and other employee benefits programs, and Terese Herwick, age 51, of Santa Monica, Calif., the owner and president of NFSI., The SECs complaint alleges that in 1999, NFSI assumed management of the Fixed Fund, an unregistered pool of assets consisting of real estate, equity securities, mutual funds, and bonds.  Although Herwick knew that a significant number of Fixed Fund assets had not performed for years or had been foreclosed upon, neither NFSI nor Herwick disclosed these facts to the Fixed Funds investors.  In January 2002, NFSI wrote off the worthless assets, another fact that NFSI and Herwick never disclosed to Fixed Fund investors.  The value of the Fixed Funds assets has fallen to approximately 50% of the amount owed to Fixed Fund investors as principal and purported accrued dividends.  As of March 31, 2003, the value of the Fixed Funds assets totaled no more than $7.4 million while the amounts it owed investors in principal and purported accrued returns totaled at least $14.1 million.  NFSI never disclosed this fact to Fund investors either.  , Instead, the complaint alleges, NFSI continued to promote the Fixed Fund as an investment vehicle that purportedly seeks preservation and protection of capital while providing regular monthly cash distributions.  Moreover, NFSI has provided Fixed Fund investors with quarterly account statements that purport to credit those investors with their contracted-for rates of return -- returns which have not been generated by the Funds underlying assets and which neither the Fund nor NFSI can possibly repay.  In addition, NFSI defrauded the Fixed Fund and its investors by charging the Fixed Fund an undisclosed management fee, which for 2002 constituted more than 10% of the value of the Fixed Funds assets.  In 2002, NFSI took over $700,000 in management fees, while in 2001 it took over $520,000 in fees, none of which was disclosed to investors., The SECs complaint alleges that NFSI and Herwicks conduct violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The SECs complaint asks the Court to permanently enjoin NFSI and Herwick from future violations of the foregoing provisions; to order NFSI and Herwick to disgorge, with prejudgment interest, all ill-gotten gains from their illegal conduct; and to pay civil penalties.  , Acting on the SECs lawsuit, on September 29, 2003, the Honorable Steven V. Wilson, United States District Judge for the Central District of California, issued an order prohibiting NFSI and Herwick from distributing funds or selling assets without notification to and permission from the SEC.  The order further required NFSI and Herwick to provide the SEC with an accounting of sources and distribution of funds since June 2003.  The Court denied the SECs request for a temporary restraining order against further violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and the SECs request for the appointment of a temporary receiver over NFSI.  The Court scheduled a trial on a preliminary injunction to begin on October 21, 2003.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18392.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Zaccagninos alleged misconduct was in part the subject of a successful enforcement action brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1998., The 15-count indictment, obtained by the United States Attorney for the Central District of Illinois (Peoria Division), alleges that Zaccagnino, his wife and another individual fraudulently raised approximately $20 million from several hundred investors by soliciting them to invest money in fictitious high-yield prime-bank trading programs, including programs involving historical railroad bonds issued in the nineteenth century.  , As a result of its lawsuit, in June 1999 the Commission succeeded in obtaining a permanent injunction against Zaccagnino enjoining him from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Further, Zaccagnino and his alter ego offshore entity, Two-Thirds International, Inc., collectively were ordered to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of nearly $2 million and directed to pay civil penalties., The Commissions civil action alleged that Zaccagnino sold historical railroad bonds as investment quality instruments or offered to place the bonds in  prime bank-type trading programs.   According to the Commissions complaint, the bonds had value only as historical memorabilia and the trading programs touted by Zaccagnino were fictitious.  The Commissions complaint further alleged that Zaccagnino and his entities raised approximately $4.8 million through the sale of  the  bonds to scores of investor at prices up to $330,000 each, and that, through his false and misleading statements, Zaccagnino violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18393.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Vatcher, a former officer of Inso Corporation, Inc., later known as eBT International, Inc., a now defunct software company headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, is scheduled to be sentenced on January 12, 2004.  Vatcher faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison, followed by a 3 year term of supervised release, and a $1,000,000 fine on each count., Vatcher, of Framingham, Massachusetts, was vice president of international sales at Inso. Vatcher admitted during his plea hearing before a Massachusetts federal court that on multiple occasions in or about 1998, he made, and caused others to make, false and misleading reports that his sales group had completed certain agreements for the sale of Inso products valued at more than $3.6 million.  In fact, Vatcher admitted that he had provided customers with side agreements that gave the purported customers the right to cancel or modify sales.  Because the customers had the right to cancel the sales, the revenue from these transactions should not have been included in Insos reported financial results.  Vatcher further admitted to deliberately concealing the side agreements from Insos finance department with the intention of causing Inso to recognize revenue for the phony sales.  As a result of Vatchers actions, Inso materially overstated its revenues for the quarters ended March 31, 1998, June 30, 1998, and September 30, 1998 in press releases and in Forms 10-Q filed with the Commission., Previously, on June 21, 2002, the Commission filed a civil enforcement action against Vatcher in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts based on the same conduct.  Simultaneous with the filing of the complaint, Vatcher consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-13, and 13b2-1 thereunder and ordering him to pay a $25,000 civil penalty., For more information see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17578.htm>Litigation Release No. 17578</a> (June 21, 2002).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18394.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Hurley, United States District Judge, Eastern District of New York, entered a final judgment of permanent injunction and other relief as to defendant Jeffrey S. Schneider.

Schneider consented to the final judgment., The allegations in the Commissions complaint filed on March 12, 2002, concern Schneiders role in a financial fraud at AppOnline.com, Inc. (AppOnline), a now-bankrupt Melville, New York-based mortgage banker.  The Commissions complaint alleged that beginning in approximately May 1997, AppOnline, formerly known as IMN Financial Corp., suffered a cash shortage.  To address this shortage, officers of AppOnline misappropriated at least $60 million AppOnlines lenders had advanced to fund specific mortgage loans, and used those funds to make different mortgage loans and to pay AppOnlines operating expenses.  To conceal the misappropriation, AppOnline prepared materially false and misleading financial statements, which were contained in its annual and quarterly reports filed with the Commission.  Thus, AppOnlines filings on Form 10-KSB for December 31, 1998, and on Form 10-K for December 31, 1999 misrepresented, among other things, that the funds AppOnline had misappropriated from its lenders was a debt owed to a related party.  The complaint alleged that Schneider served as an auditor during the audit of AppOnlines December 31, 1998 financial statements, and that the firm he was associated with issued an audit opinion that falsely represented that AppOnlines financial statements had been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and that the audit had been conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.  The complaint also alleged that during 1999 and 2000 Schneider worked as an internal accountant at AppOnline and helped to prepare its falsified December 31, 1999 financial statements., The Commission also announced that it simultaneously instituted and settled administrative proceedings against Schneider.  Schneider consented to an Order, pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commissions Rules of Practice, suspending him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant, with the right to seek reinstatement in five years.

Potter and his father, George R. Potter, of Bedford, New Hampshire, in connection with insider trading in the securities of Sepracor, Inc., a Massachusetts-based pharmaceutical company.

The $55,172 amount represents the profit derived from George Potters illegal October 2000 trading in Sepracor options.  , The Commissions complaint, filed on January 30, 2003, alleged that Timothy Potter, a manager in Sepracors accounting department, learned by October 18, 2000, that Eli Lilly and Company might terminate a license agreement with Sepracor concerning the development of a new version of Lillys top-selling antidepressant, Prozac.  According to the complaint, that same day, Timothy Potter tipped George Potter about the potential termination.  Within half an hour, George Potter, acting on the tip, purchased put options on Sepracor stock for $30,694  in effect, betting that the price of Sepracor stock would fall.  The next day, on October 19, after Sepracor publicly announced the termination of the license agreement, George Potter sold the options, profiting by $55,172.  According to the complaint, on April 18, 2001, George Potter transferred $55,000 to Timothy Potter., In related criminal actions brought by the New Hampshire U.S. Attorneys Office based on the same underlying conduct, the Potters each pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit insider trading.

Siegel (Siegel) in civil contempt for his failure to comply with the Courts prior repatriation order.  The Court conducted an evidentiary hearing over the course of three days after an Order to Show Cause was issued upon the SECs and Receivers Joint Motion, filed on September 27, 2002.  The Court held that the SEC and Receiver presented clear and convincing evidence that Siegel controls, or at one time controlled assets of investors which were transferred offshore, and that Siegel has failed to repatriate any of those assets and deposit them in the Courts registry as previously ordered by the Court.  The Court further held that Siegel, who invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination at the hearing, failed to produce any evidence showing he made reasonable efforts in good faith to repatriate those assets.  Siegels invocation of his rights under the Fifth Amendment did not, according to the Court, discharge his burden of producing evidence that he was unable to comply with the Courts repatriation order.  The Court has requested the parties to file briefs concerning the appropriate sanctions for Siegels contempt. , The contempt proceeding arises from the SECs emergency action, filed on July 24, 2002, against American Financial Group of Aventura, Inc. (AFG), a Florida corporation, and Siegel, AFGs senior vice president and director of investments, and relief defendant American Wealth Management of Aventura, Inc., a Florida corporation, in connection with an alleged fraudulent securities offering.  The SEC alleged that Siegel and others had been fraudulently offering and selling investment contracts in the form of fractional participation in a restricted stock loan program, from its Aventura, Florida office.  The SECs complaint alleges that AFG enticed investors with promises of high returns with low risk because investments were purportedly over-collateralized with restricted stock. The SECs complaint further alleges that Siegel, a recidivist securities laws violator, misappropriated investor monies and issued false statements to investors falsely showing high returns when, in fact, the investments were losing value because Siegel was misappropriating the money raised by AFG.  The SECs complaint also alleges that AFG misled investors by failing to disclose in its offering materials and website that Siegel had a long history of securities laws violations, including an injunction entered against him in 1987 for participating in a stock manipulation scheme.   The SEC charged AFG and Siegel with violations of Sections 17(a)(1), 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  , On July 25, 2002, the Court granted the SECs request for a Temporary Asset Freeze Order (TAF), and other emergency relief.  The TAF provided, among other things that Siegel repatriate assets.  On August 15, 2002, the Court entered an Order of Temporary Asset Freeze (Order), by consent, against Siegel.  The Order required Siegel to comply with the repatriation provision contained in the TAF.  Because Siegel failed to comply with that Order, on September 27, 2002, the SEC and Receiver jointly moved for an Order to Show Cause why he should not be held in contempt.  , <i>See also</i> Litigation Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18192.htm>18192</a> (June 16, 2003), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17754.htm>17754</a> (September 30, 2002) and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17638.htm>17638</a> (July 30, 2002).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18400.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The complaint alleges:, Soon after, the employee retracted this initial conclusion and informed English that book inventory exceeded the physical counts by more than $2 million, requiring that English decrease the book inventory number.  Despite this information, in August 2000, English proceeded to authorize the erroneous $2.6 million entry., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, English consented to the entry of a Final Judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of (or aiding and abetting violations of) Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13 and 13b2-1.  The Final Judgment also imposes a $25,000 civil penalty and prohibits English from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years., B.	The Cease-and-Desist Order Against NCI, The Commission also issued a settled cease-and-desist order today (the Order) against NCI.  The findings in the Order involved a number of accounting errors at the company, many of which were caused by the implementation of the MIS system in May 1999.  The Order notes that the Commission took into account remedial acts promptly undertaken by the respondent and cooperation afforded the Commission staff., NCI neither admitted nor denied the findings in the Order.  In the Order, the Commission Ordered that NCI cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.

In addition, Colwell has agreed to be barred from acting as an officer or director of a public company, and will pay $300,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of  $200,000.  As part of this settlement, Colwell will continue to cooperate with on-going investigations into Enron Corp. by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice Enron Task Force., As alleged in the Complaint, Colwell, along with others at Enron, engaged in a wide ranging scheme to defraud by manipulating Enrons publicly reported earnings through a variety of devices designed to produce materially false and misleading financial results.  This scheme included the misuse of reserve accounts, concealment of losses, inflation of asset values, and deliberate use of improper accounting treatment for transactions.  For example, for year 2000, Colwell and others are alleged to have deferred over $400 million in earnings into reserve accounts within Enron North America (ENA).  Subsequently, during first and second quarter 2001, it is alleged that Colwell and others used reserve accounts within ENA to mask over $1 billion in losses associated with Enrons retail energy business, Enron Energy Services (EES).  It is further alleged that when Enron needed earnings in third quarter 2001, Colwell and others released from ENA reserve accounts over $200 million of previously deferred trading profits.  The Complaint also alleges that Colwell and others manipulated the value of Enrons largest private merchant asset, Mariner Energy Inc., and improperly avoided a write-down associated with the disposition of its subsidiary, Houston Pipeline Co., Specifically, the Commissions Complaint alleges as follows:, In agreeing to this settlement, the Commission took into account Colwells continuing cooperation in the on-going investigations being conducted by the Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice Enron Task Force., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18403.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a><!-- End text -->,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18403.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

(United States District Court for the District of Connecticut</i>, Civil Action No. 03-CV-01524-MRK).</h2>]","[The Commission announced that, on September 26, 2003, a Connecticut federal court issued a written order imposing a preliminary injunction, asset freeze and other ancillary relief against Connecticut resident Blake A. Prater and his Guilford, Connecticut-based company, Wellspring Capital Group, Inc., in connection with an internet Ponzi scheme.  The Court had previously issued a temporary restraining order granting substantially the same relief.  In ruling on the preliminary injunction, which the Commission had requested in connection with its pending fraud action filed on September 5, 2003, the Honorable Mark Kravitz, United States District Judge for the District of Connecticut, found that the Commission had made a prima facie showing that Prater and Wellspring had engaged in securities fraud and other violations of the federal securities laws., Based on the Commissions prima facie showing, the Court found that Prater and Wellspring operated a sophisticated Internet Ponzi scheme that raised millions of dollars from over twenty thousand investors.  On the same basis, the Court also found that Praters scheme used a series of interrelated Internet web sites and a network of agents operating throughout the United States to guarantee prospective investors exorbitant returns through a variety of programs.  Under one set of programs, Prater, through Wellspring, promised that, in exchange for a small sum of money, it would pay investors returns as high as 1,000 percent per year in the form of payments for various living expenses of the investors, such as car loans, rent, or business expenses.  In ruling on the preliminary injunction, the Court concluded that the websites operated by the defendants appear to underscore the wisdom of a tried and true investment axiom: If it looks too good to be true, it probably is., The Court also found at this preliminary stage in the litigation that the Commissions evidence showed that Wellspring claimed to use the investor funds to invest in a portfolio of companies, and that the profits from the portfolio, in turn, paid for the exorbitant returns to investors.  The Court noted, however, that the Court has not been presented with any evidence of any business or investment activity that would allow Defendants to provide the extravagant returns they are promising - that is, short of using the money of later investors to pay off earlier investors. The Court concluded that the SEC was not required to wait until such a rob Peter to pay Paul scheme collapsed of its own weight and that a preliminary injunction was therefore appropriate.   The Court also found that the Commission had produced evidence showing that Prater made material misrepresentations about the portfolio companies and investment offerings and that he failed to disclose his criminal history, which includes forgery and fraud convictions, to investors., In issuing the preliminary injunction, the Court ruled that the Commission had made a prima facie showing that Prater and Wellspring violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  , For additional information, see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18336.htm>Litigation Release No. 18336</a>.,  ]"

Happ for insider trading in the stock of Galileo Corporation, formerly a Sturbridge, Massachusetts company.  The SEC had alleged that, in late June 1998, while Happ was a director of Galileo and the chairman of the board of directors audit committee, Happ learned from the companys chief executive officer that Galileo was experiencing difficulties in its fiscal 1998 third quarter and that the CEO needed to meet with him to discuss those difficulties.  According to the SEC, upon receiving this information, Happ sold all his shares of the companys stock on June 29, 1998.  When the company eventually announced these difficulties and their effect on the companys 1998 third quarter results to the public, the stock price dropped 64%.  The court will determine the amount of the loss Happ avoided as a result of his June 29 sale. , The jury heard closing arguments in the two week-trial yesterday and announced its verdict today.

The SEC charged each of those individuals with engaging in insider trading in the stock of Hispanic Broadcasting, ahead of the June 12, 2002 announcement that Univision would acquire Hispanic Broadcasting in an all-stock transaction.  The defendants have agreed, without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, to pay, in the aggregate, over $450,000 to settle the SECs claims against them.   , Named in the action are: (1) Stephen A. White of Dallas, Texas, a registered representative with the Dallas office of Stephens, Inc., an SEC-registered broker-dealer and investment adviser; (2) Stephen Whites brother, William D. White, III, of Dallas, Texas; (3) Ernest J. Bieling, of Wayne, New Jersey, a former employee in Univisions corporate finance department; and (4) Robert W. Hughes, of Austin, Texas, a member of the board of directors of Hispanic Broadcasting., In its complaint, the SEC alleges that, in May and June of 2002, the defendants separately obtained material nonpublic information regarding the acquisition of Hispanic Broadcasting by Univision, and based on that information, each of the defendants purchased  or recommended that others purchase  Hispanic Broadcasting stock, prior to the public announcement of the acquisition.  Specifically, according to the SEC, Stephen White, after learning about the acquisition from a potential client  a large Hispanic Broadcasting shareholder  recommended Hispanic Broadcasting shares to a personal friend and a brokerage customer, both of whom then purchased the stock ahead of the announcement.  The SEC further alleges that William White purchased the stock ahead of the announcement, based on material nonpublic information about the impending acquisition, which he had misappropriated from his mother.  Bieling and Hughes each purchased the stock ahead of the announcement, based on material nonpublic information about the impending acquisition that they acquired in the course of their positions and responsibilities at Univision and Hispanic Broadcasting, respectively.  , By their conduct, each of the defendants violated a duty of trust and confidence:  Stephen White and William White violated duties of trust and confidence that they owed to the parties from whom they learned of the acquisition; Bieling violated a duty of trust and confidence that he owed to Univision, his employer; and Hughes violated a fiduciary duty that he, as a member of the board of directors, owed to Hispanic Broadcastings shareholders.  Following the public announcement of the acquisition on June 12, 2002, the price of Hispanic Broadcastings stock increased, and Hughes, Bieling, William White, and the two individuals who purchased the stock based on Stephen Whites recommendations, earned trading profits.  , Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, each of the individual defendants has made, and the SEC has accepted, an offer of settlement in which each defendant consents: to the entry of a permanent injunction enjoining them from further violations of the below-listed provisions of the federal securities laws; to disgorgement of trading profits, plus prejudgment interest; and to payment of a civil money penalty.  Specifically, (1) Stephen White will disgorge $195,333 in profits that were earned by the individuals who purchased Hispanic Broadcasting shares based on his recommendations, plus prejudgment interest of $11,825, and pay a civil money penalty of $195,333; (2) William White will disgorge $9,790 in illicit profits, plus prejudgment interest of $549, and pay a civil money penalty of $14,685; (3) Ernest Bieling will disgorge $500 in illegal profits, plus prejudgment interest of $28, and pay a civil money penalty of $1,000; and (4) Robert Hughes will disgorge $13,060 in illicit profits, plus prejudgment interest of $790, pay a civil money penalty of $13,060, and consent to the entry of an order permanently barring him from acting as an officer or director for any publicly held company.

(IMCL), tipped his father, Jack Waksal, with the disappointing news about ImClone, that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was expected to soon issue a decision rejecting for review ImClones pending application to market its cancer treatment, Erbitux.  Before this news became public, Jack Waksal sold his own ImClone stock and ImClone stock owned by Patti Waksal, who is Jack Waksals daughter and Sam Waksals sister.  The Commissions second amended complaint alleges that both Sam Waksal and Jack Waksal violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and that Sam Waksal also violated Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 16a-3 thereunder. , Specifically, the Commissions complaint alleges as follows:, The Commission originally filed insider trading charges against Sam Waksal on June 12, 2002 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.

The criminal information alleged that Marks, who at the time was Vertex=s highest-ranking attorney,  learned on September 20, 2001, that Vertex planned to announce the suspension of clinical trials of one of its promising drugs on September 24.  According to the information, on September 21, Marks liquidated all of his Vertex stock despite having previously acknowledged in writing that the impending release would not be viewed favorably by Wall Street and that he should not sell his Vertex shares.  Sentencing has been scheduled for December 16, 2003., According to the criminal information, at the time he traded, Marks was the designated attorney for employees to contact regarding compliance with Vertex=s employee securities trading policy.  In that capacity, the information alleged, Marks wrote Vertex=s CEO an email on September 20, advising him to make sure that an employee who had requested permission to trade had no knowledge of the impending press release.  According to the information, Marks= email went on to say:, <p class=em2>. . .  I guess I am troubled about any employee trading prior to that release because it is likely to have an effect on the stock (looks like I can=t sell any shares) and, depending on the degree of that effect, could create the perception of insider trading. . .   . , The criminal information alleged that, on September 21, less than 24 hours after writing this email to the CEO, Marks sold 20,900 shares of Vertex at an average price of $22.81 per share, receiving $476,765.  According to the information, Marks traded in breach of a fiduciary duty not to trade in Vertex=s stock while in possession of material, nonpublic information regarding Vertex.

Montana, Jr., Melvin R. Lyttle and Paul E. Knight raised approximately $30 million from about 29 investors through the fraudulent sale of investments in a non-existent bank trading program (Trading Program).  The Complaint alleges that Montana, Lyttle and Knight raised these funds through the entities that they controlled: Montanas Worldwide T&amp;P, Inc., Lyttles First National Equity, LLC and Knights P.K. Trust &amp; Holding, Inc., The SECs Complaint alleges that Montana, Lyttle and Knight told investors that they would earn high returns, risk-free in the Trading Program, which purported to invest money in the trading of various instruments including medium term notes.  In reality, the Trading Program did not exist and the funds were not kept safe.  According to the Complaint, Lyttle misappropriated at least $6 million for his personal use instead of investing the investors funds in the supposed Trading Program.  The Complaint alleges that the remaining $24 million in investor funds was transferred to Defendant UTA-BVI, Ltd. which used the funds to engage in highly leveraged and unprofitable stock trading.  According to the Complaint, Defendant Violet Gail Eldridge, the president of UTA-BVI, controlled the brokerage accounts used for the stock trading., The SECs Complaint also alleges that Eldridge and UTA-BVI, in turn, defrauded First National Equity and P.K. Trust.  Pursuant to trust management agreements, UTA-BVI agreed to serve as trustee for a trust that consisted of the $24 million in investor funds transferred to UTA-BVI by First National Equity and P.K. Trust and which identified First National Equity and P.K. Trust as beneficiaries of the trust.  According to the Complaint, instead of managing the funds for the benefit of First National Equity and P.K. Trust, UTA-BVI, among other things, used the trust funds to pay Eldridges personal expenses and also transferred funds to bank accounts that she controlled in the name of the Relief Defendants, The United Tribes of the Americas, Inc. and Executive Bureau of Research and Recovery, Inc.  The Complaint alleges that Eldridge never disclosed to First National Equity and P.K. Trust that UTA-BVI would use the trust funds in this manner. , The SECs Complaint alleges that Montana, Lyttle, Knight, Worldwide T&amp;P, First National Equity and P.K. Trust violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10b of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, that Montana, Knight and Worldwide T&amp;P violated Sections 15(a)(1) and 15(c)(1) of the Exchange Act, that UTA-BVI violated Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act) and that Eldridge aided and abetted UTA-BVIs violations of the Advisers Act.  The SECs Complaint requests that the Court permanently enjoin Montana, Lyttle, Knight, Worldwide T&amp;P, First National Equity P.K. Trust, UTA-BVI and Eldridge from the securities law violations alleged, order each of them to pay a civil penalty and order Lyttle, Knight, First National Equity, P.K. Trust, UTA-BVI, Eldridge and Relief Defendants The United Tribes of the Americas, Inc. and Executive Bureau of Research and Recovery, Inc. to disgorge, with prejudgment interest, all ill-gotten gains., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18411.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  ]"

El-Khalidi, who resides in Saudi Arabia, has agreed, without admitting or denying the SECs claims, to pay a $25,000 penalty to settle the SECs civil case.  In a related action, the SEC also announced today the issuance of a settled cease-and-desist order against El-Khalidi and AADC.  Both actions are based on violations by El-Khalidi or AADC of the reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws.  , The SECs civil complaint alleges, and the SECs cease-and-desist order finds, that El-Khalidi failed to disclose to AADCs shareholders, auditor, and other officers and directors that AADCs largest asset, a mining lease located in Saudi Arabia, which AADC obtained from the Saudi Arabian government, was at risk of being terminated.  According to the SEC, between May 2000 and November 2002, the Saudi Arabian government repeatedly notified AADC, via correspondence sent to El-Khalidi in Saudi Arabia, that AADC was not in compliance with the work schedule set forth in its lease agreement, and that if AADC failed to comply promptly, the lease could be terminated.  The SEC alleges and finds that El-Khalidi withheld this information until approximately December 2002, when he disclosed the actual status of the mining lease to AADCs shareholders, auditor, and other officers and directors.  According to the SEC, as a result of El-Khalidis actions, AADCs books and records were inaccurate and AADC omitted material information from its SEC filings, including AADCs September 30, 2002 Form 10-Q, which El-Khalidi improperly certified as true and correct.  In addition, the SEC alleges and finds that AADCs internal accounting controls, which failed to detect the situation, were inadequate., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SECs complaint, El-Khalidi has agreed to pay a $25,000 civil penalty in the U.S. district court action.  Without admitting or denying the findings in the SECs administrative order:  (1) AADC has agreed to cease and desist from violating Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder, and comply with certain undertakings designed to improve AADCs reporting and record keeping practices and enhance its internal accounting controls; and (2) El-Khalidi has agreed to cease and desist from violating Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-14 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and causing AADCs violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18412.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18412.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Complaint alleges that since late 2002, hundreds of overseas investors have been defrauded by a scheme organized by David M. Wolfson and Gino Carlucci of Salt Lake City, Utah, and Sukumo, Ltd. of Vientiane, Laos.  It is further alleged that Sukumo raised at least $16 million from more than 1,100 investors by selling restricted Regulation S shares in Stem Genetics, Inc., F10 Oil &amp; Gas Properties, Diversified Financial Resources Corporation, Valesc Holdings, Inc., and NCI Holdings, Inc., with 70% of the offering proceeds wired to Sukumo and 15% to 20% of the proceeds wired to Wolfson or entities under his control.  It is further alleged that Wolfson and persons affiliated with F10, Diversified and Valesc manipulated the prices of those securities in trading on the OTC Bulletin Board, thereby inflating the price Sukumo charged investors.  Finally, it is alleged that Stem Genetics, F10, Diversified, Valesc and NCIH, aided and abetted by certain of their officers, made false filings with the Commission and that those officers falsely certified the filings of the issuers when those filings contained material misrepresentations and omitted to state material facts.  , In making its sales of securities Sukumo allegedly misrepresented the amount of its commissions by telling investors, orally and in writing, it was receiving only 2% of the sales price of the stock rather than the 70% it was actually receiving.  Sukumo also allegedly failed to inform investors the stock they were purchasing was restricted stock.  The issuers allegedly stated in their filings that Sukumo was purchasing shares from the issuers when, in fact, it was simply acting as a sales agent for the issuers for a 70% commission.  The issuers also allegedly failed, in some or all of their filings, to disclose that Wolfson and the entities controlled by him, NuWay Holding, Inc., Momentous Group, LLC, and Leeward Consulting Group, LLC, were receiving 15% to 20% of the offering proceeds.  In addition to these misrepresentations, it is alleged that Stem Genetics and its chief executive officer, Howard Robertson, made material misrepresentations on the companys web site concerning Stem Geneticss business operations.  Finally, F10, Diversified and Valesc allegedly failed to disclose that the price of their stock was being manipulated in trading on the OTC Bulletin Board.  It is alleged that the price of F10 stock was manipulated by Wolfson, Momentous, Jon R. Marple, the son of F10s principal officers, and by his company Grateful Internet Associates, LLC.  It is alleged the price of Diversified stock was manipulated by John Chapman, Diversifieds chief executive officer.  It is also alleged the price of Valesc stock was manipulated by Jeremy D. Kraus, Valescs chief executive officer and by Samuel Cohen, the companys chief financial officer.  , The Commission seeks the entry of temporary restraining orders against Sukumo, which is also known as The Sukumo Group, The Fujiwara Group, First Chartered Capital Corporation, First Colonial Trust, First China Capital, and International Investment Holding, and Michael Sydney Newman, its control person.  The Commission also seeks the entry of preliminary and permanent injunctions against Wolfson, Carlucci, NuWay Holding, Inc.; Momentous Group, LLC; Leeward Consulting Group, LLC; Stem Genetics, Inc.; Howard H.

Asset freezes are sought against all defendants except Diversified, Chapman, Valesc, Kraus and Cohen.  , The Complaint alleges all the defendants in the action have been violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.  In addition, the Complaint alleges F10, Diversified, Valesc and NCIH have been violating the issuer reporting provision of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and that:  F10 and Valesc violated Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 under the Exchange Act by filing false annual and quarterly reports; Diversified violated Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 by filing false annual, current and quarterly reports; NCIH violated Rules 12b-20, 13a-11 and 13a-13 by filing false current and quarterly reports.  The Complaint also alleges that Jon H. Marple and Blake aided and abetted F10s reporting violations and that they violated Rule 13a-14 under the Exchange Act by falsely certifying those reports.  Kraus and Cohen were charged with aiding and abetting Valescs reporting violations and with falsely certifying its filings.

Dyer of Manchester, Massachusetts, and two Massachusetts-based companies controlled by Dyer, Resource F, LLC, and Bunker Hill Aviation, LLC, in connection with a $22 million fraudulent trading scheme. The final judgment enjoined Dyer and his companies from further violations of the federal securities laws.  The final judgment also ordered Dyer and his companies to pay a total of $577,667 in disgorgement and interest, and further ordered Dyer to pay a $110,000 civil penalty., In its complaint, filed on April 16, 2001, the Commission alleged that, between 1997 and 2000, Dyer, Resource F, Bunker Hill Aviation, and others participated in a fraudulent trading scheme that raised approximately $22 million from at least 50 investors, many of whom were members of the Christian Science Church.  According to the complaint, Dyer helped promote the trading scheme through Resource F and administered it through Bunker Hill Aviation, and solicited investors using misrepresentations typical of Prime Bank-type investment frauds, including that the investment involved high-quality debt instruments and that investors principal was never at risk and could be returned after one year.  , Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Dyer, Resource F, and Bunker Hill Aviation consented to the judgment entered by the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, which permanently enjoins them from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Dyer and Resource F also were enjoined from future violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act, and Dyer was furthermore enjoined from future violations of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.  Dyer, Resource F, and Bunker Hill Aviation also were held jointly and severally liable for disgorgement of $472,590, plus $99,321 pre-judgment interest and $5,755 post-judgment interest thereon, and Dyer was ordered to pay a civil penalty of $110,000.  Dyer has also offered to settle related administrative proceedings, and the Commission instituted a settled Order on October 16, 2003, permanently barring Dyer from association with any investment adviser or broker-dealer., Dyer, Resource F, and Bunker Hill Aviation were the last defendants in this case.  The other defendants were Eric E. Resteiner and Voldemar A. VonStrasdas, both most recently of the Bahamas, and Miles M. Harbur of Jupiter, Florida.  The District Court entered final judgments by default against Resteiner and VonStrasdas in August 2002, holding them jointly and severally liable for disgorgement of more than $25 million, and assessing each a civil penalty of $4.4million.  The District Court also previously entered final judgment by consent against Harbur, holding him liable for disgorgement of $1.1 million, plus prejudgment interest thereon, but waiving payment based on Harburs financial condition.  As with Dyer, the District Court enjoined Resteiner, VonStrasdas, and Harbur from violating the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws.   , Unscrupulous promoters continue to victimize the public with Prime Bank schemes.

According to the Commission, Paul E. Nelson and William Wright of San Diego, and Michael Alexander of Solana Beach, California, sold investments in a purported mortgage lending business that guaranteed a 12% annual rate of return to investors.  The Commission alleges that these individuals misappropriated at least $1 million of investor funds, with Alexander, the President of the company that managed the investments, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars at a horse racing track located a few minutes from the companys office.  At the Commissions request, on Friday, October 10, the Honorable William H. Alsup of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California issued a temporary restraining order against the Rose Fund LLC, the Rose Fund Inc., TRF Holdings, Inc., Michael Alexander, Paul Nelson, and William Wright, restraining them for committing future violations of certain provisions of the federal securities laws and freezing the assets of these defendants as well as the assets of relief defendants Rose Collections, Inc., Pacific Video Network, Inc., Resort Management Co., Inc., Web Inventions, Inc., Who Banging, Inc., and YAE, Inc., pending a further hearing on the Commissions motion for a preliminary injunction and appointment of a receiver.  The Court also deferred ruling on the Commissions request that a receiver be appointed to manage the Rose Fund until the hearing., The Commissions complaint alleges that, beginning in early 2003, the Rose Fund ran ads in about a dozen major California newspapers promising 12-15% annual returns on an investment described as safe, IRA/401K approved, and secured by California real estate.  Investors responding to the ad were told by salesperson Wright that the Rose Funds mortgage lending business was 30 years old and outperformed the stock market.  These representations were false.  According to the Commission, the company was only formed in late 2002 and did not make any home loans until mid-2003.  Even then, the investments were risky, had not been approved by the IRS or any other government agency, and only a portion of the funds went towards actual home loans., By September 2003, the Rose Fund and a related entity, TRF Holdings, had raised at least $3.3 million from over 100 investors in California and nationwide.  The Commission alleges that, in order to dupe investors into believing their investments were safe and profitable, the Rose Fund made payments representing purported interest from the companys mortgage business.  In reality, the money came from investors own funds - a classic Ponzi scheme.  , The Commissions complaint charges the Rose Fund, TRF Holdings, and their manager, Rose Fund, Inc., as well as Nelson, Wright, and Alexander, with violating the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission also sued Wright for acting as an unregistered securities broker in violation of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.

Benjamin Franklin Cook [3-99CV05701-R, USDC, NDTX (Dallas Division)] seized assets acquired by Burr as a result of recent fraudulent activities., Burr and a company he controlled, Cornerstone Management, L.L.P., are both subject to judgments in excess of $4 million in the Cook matter.  These judgments arise from Burrs participation in the Dennel Finance Limited (Dennel) fraud, a Ponzi scheme master-minded by Phoenix, Arizona resident Benjamin Franklin Cook.  The Dennel scheme, which centered around the offer and sale of non-existent prime bank securities, bilked investors of approximately $46 million before the Commission shut it down in March 1999 through an emergency action in District Court. [LITIGATION RELEASE NO. 16089]., On June 22, 2000, District Court Judge Jerry Buchmeyer of the Northern District of Texas granted the request of the Commission and the Court-appoint Receiver to place in receivership all assets of Burr and several entities he had created to conceal funds and property obtained through the Dennel scheme.  On June 25, 2003, Judge Buchmeyer granted a freeze of assets obtained as a consequence of Burrs additional fraudulent conduct in North Carolina and expanded the Receivership to include new entities created by Burr and other persons involved in the additional fraud.  On the same day, while the Receiver seized real estate, vehicles and other property accumulated by Burr and others, agents of the North Carolina Securities Division arrested Robert Burr and his brother, Daniel Burr., In addition to the charges brought by North Carolina, Burr still faces sentencing in connection with criminal charges brought against him by state of Arizona for his participation in the Dennel scheme.  Burr pleaded guilty to two counts of Fraudulent Schemes and Artifices and agreed to make $4.9 million in restitution in the Arizona case.  Burrs three-to-10 year sentence in the Arizona criminal case will run concurrently with Burrs incarceration in North Carolina., Burr was also briefly incarcerated in Seagoville Federal Detention Center in Seagoville, Texas, based on an order of contempt issued in the Commissions action.

(Blue Chip), Solo Ventures, LLC (Solo Ventures), Carl Jackson (Jackson), Redmill Holdings, LLC (Redmill), Edgar Mojica (Mojica), and Durietha Dziorney (Dziorney), had received ill-gotten gains in connection with the fraudulent scheme and had no legitimate claims to the payments they received from the defendants. , In granting the Commissions motion for summary judgment, the Court ruled that the defendants should be permanently enjoined from future violations of the antifraud and broker-dealer registration provisions of the securities laws and awarded the following amounts of disgorgement and pre-judgment interest against the defendants and relief defendants: 1) defendant Thorn was ordered to disgorge $5,070,395 of ill-gotten gains plus $1,802,132 of pre-judgment interest; 2) defendant McKinney was ordered to disgorge $54,200 plus $16,499 of pre-judgment interest and was held jointly and severally liable for $1,434,757 of disgorgement and $294,632 of pre-judgment interest imposed against his company, International Trading Partners, Ltd., pursuant to a previous Court order; 3) defendant Malizia was ordered to disgorge an amount to be determined later by the Court; 4) relief defendant Weizenegger was ordered to disgorge $1,451,920 and $632,643 of pre-judgment interest; 5) relief defendants Harris and his two companies, Blue Chip and Solo Ventures, were ordered to disgorge $505,920 plus $139,867 of pre-judgment interest; 6) relief defendants Jackson and Redmill were ordered to disgorge $282,380 plus $70,721 of pre-judgment interest; 7) relief defendant Mojica was ordered to disgorge an amount to be determined later by the Court; and 8) relief defendant Dziorney was ordered to disgorge $32,919 plus $5,081 of pre-judgment interest.  The Court had previously ordered Dziorney to surrender a $61,500 diamond ring that Thorn had bought for her with investor funds.  Lastly, the Court ordered Thorn, Malizia, and McKinney to pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined at a later hearing., The Commission alleged that from February 1998 through April 2001, the defendants and others raised approximately $75 million through the offer and sale of investments in a series of purported European bank trading programs.  The defendants programs exhibited many of the characteristics of the fraudulent prime bank schemes that the Commission, the Federal Reserve Board and other regulators have warned do not exist.  The defendants told investors that the programs involved the trading of bank instruments issued by foreign banks; they promised investors returns ranging as high as 200 percent per month; they assured investors that the investments were risk free; and they warned investors that participation in the trading programs required total secrecy and confidentiality.  In reality, the defendants dissipated much of the investors funds to pay personal and business expenses, purported returns to earlier investors, make payments to the relief defendants and undisclosed salaries and fees for themselves.  , The Court previously entered judgments against several other defendants and relief defendants.  The Court entered a judgment on June 22, 2001, against defendant Craig Morgan in which he consented to be permanently enjoined from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; on December 23, 2002 the Court ordered Morgan to pay a $20,000 civil penalty.  On April 12, 2001, the Court entered a judgment against defendant Karen Estrada (Estrada) in which she consented to be permanently enjoined from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, and Sections 10(b), 15(a), and 15(c) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5 and 15c1-2 thereunder.  On the same day, the Court also entered a judgment against her companies, Fund Global, LLC and Global Equity Group, LLC, in which they consented to be permanently enjoined from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5.   On September 30, 2002, the Court ordered Estrada to disgorge $625,975 and her companies to disgorge $1,491,000.  Estradas disgorgement award is presently subject to a pending motion for reconsideration.  On February 21, 2003, the Court entered a default judgment against International Trading Partners, Ltd. permanently enjoining it from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering it to pay $1,434,757 in disgorgement plus $294, 632 in prejudgment interest.  On April 28, 2003, the Court entered default judgments against several relief defendants ordering: 1) Allen George to disgorge $79,300 plus $13,495 in pre-judgment interest; 2) Leon Heard and his company, Alices International Salon &amp; Spa to disgorge $80,000 plus $5,901 in pre-judgment interest; and 3) Rene Sorra and his company, RLS International Investors, LLC to disgorge $410,125 plus $83,240 in pre-judgment interest. ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18419.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Levine and Marie A. Levine liable for financial fraud based on their overstating the assets of C.E.C. Industries Corporation (CEC).  Gerald Levine, age 70, was CECs chief executive officer; his wife Marie, age 56, was CECs secretary-treasurer, the companys principal financial officer.  The jury found that the Levines violated the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act):  Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, and Securities Act Sections 17(a)(1), (2), and (3).  The Levines were also found to have violated Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-1, which prohibit the falsification of a public companys books and records., The Commissions complaint, filed on September 28, 1999, alleged that the Levines overstated CECs assets in reports that they filed with the Commission for CECs fiscal years 1996 and 1997.  The complaint also alleged that the Levines, acting through another corporate entity, Wire to Wire Inc., profited from their fraud by selling CEC stock while they knew that they had overstated CECs assets.  In particular, the complaint alleged that the Levines overstated the value of two purported corporate assets (1) a 9,000-acre tract of land in Tennessee that they claimed held 52 million tons of coal and substantial timber assets; and (2) forty-one paintings by Sky Jones, which they claimed had a value of $1.7 million.  The Commission proved at trial that CEC (and its corporate affiliates) did not even own the land and that the paintings were worth no more than $10,350. , The Court has not yet determined the sanctions against the Levines.  The Commissions complaint seeks bars permanently prohibiting them from serving as officers or directors of any publicly traded company, a permanent injunction against future violations of the securities laws, disgorgement of illicit profits from sales of CEC stock, and civil penalties.  Previously, on September 11, 2001, CEC settled the Commissions financial fraud charges against the company, without admitting or denying the allegations, by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that included a permanent injunction., The Commission acknowledges the valuable assistance provided by several CEC shareholders, who brought to the Commissions attention many salient facts related to this matter.

Collins to a term of 71 months in federal prison, plus three years supervised release, and ordered him to pay $290,000 in restitution in connection with his obstructing an SEC investigation and willful violation of a court ordered asset freeze., Collins previously entered into a plea agreement with the United States Attorney for the Western District of Oklahoma pursuant to which he pleaded guilty to one count of obstruction of justice and one count of wire fraud.  These violations are the subject of the Commissions civil contempt proceedings against Collins in the Western District of Oklahoma., In its contempt action, the Commission alleged that Collins had willfully violated the terms of an asset freeze order entered against Garry W. Stroud and aided and abetted Stroud in violating the terms of the asset freeze order.  On November 18, 2002, Judge Lee R. West, United States District Judge for the Western District of Oklahoma, found Collins in civil contempt and ordered him to turn over $187,000 in property obtained from Stroud both before and after the entry of the asset freeze order.  In response to Judge Wests order to turn over funds and property to the receiver in the Stroud case, Collins faxed to the receivers office a bogus promissory note allegedly signed by a third-party agreeing to pay the money due under the contempt order.  Simultaneously with his efforts to deceive the receiver, Collins raised an additional $100,000 from other victims in a separate scheme.  As a consequence of the bogus promissory note, and his failure to comply with the contempt order, Judge West ordered Collins incarcerated to coerce his compliance.  At the time of his incarceration, the FBI swore out a criminal complaint against Collins, which ultimately led to his plea.,  ]"

(WMI) officers, Rodney R. Proto (Proto) and Earl E. DeFrates (DeFrates).  The Commissions Complaint charges Proto and DeFrates with insider trading in WMI stock, and with making public statements to Wall Street analysts, investment bankers, and investors, while employed by the company in May and June 1999, which they knew, or were reckless in not knowing, were materially false or misleading.  At the time of their actions, Proto was WMIs President, Chief Operating Officer, and a member of the WMI Board of Directors, and DeFrates was WMIs Chief Financial Officer., The Commission also filed a separate civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas against WMIs former Chief Accounting Officer, Bruce E. Snyder, Jr. (Snyder).  The Commissions Complaint against Snyder, which is not settled, charges him with insider trading in WMI stock and preparing, reviewing, and signing a materially false or misleading Form 10-Q that WMI filed with the Commission for the first quarter of its fiscal year ended December 31, 1999.  , The Commissions Complaint against Proto and DeFrates alleges that each sold WMI stock in May and/or June 1999, while in possession of material, nonpublic information that WMIs reported pretax income for the first quarter of fiscal year 1999 included tens of millions of dollars of undisclosed, non-recurring income items that inflated WMIs first quarter earnings per share (EPS) by $0.09 or 17%.  The Complaint also alleges that Proto and DeFrates presented a materially false or misleading picture of the Companys first quarter operations to Wall Street analysts and investors by failing to disclose in a May 6, 1999 press release they approved, and in a public conference call they held with Wall Street analysts, that WMIs reported first quarter pretax income and EPS figures included a material amount of non-recurring items.  The Complaint alleges that if Proto and DeFrates had properly disclosed the non-recurring items, the investing public would have learned, among other things, that the companys reported quarterly earnings from normal operations were $0.52 per share, $0.09 per share lower than its first quarter 1999 EPS guidance and lower than its fourth quarter 1998 EPS., The Commissions Complaint against Proto and DeFrates further alleges that they made additional materially false or misleading statements in June and July 1999, about WMIs ability to meet its previously announced second quarter 1999 earnings guidance of $0.78 to $0.82 per share.  The Complaint alleges that between June 7 and July 2, 1999, on at least six separate occasions, Proto and/or DeFrates confirmed the companys second quarter 1999 EPS guidance in conversations with Wall Street analysts, investment bankers, and members of the public, even though they knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that WMI would fall well short of this previously stated earnings guidance. , The Commissions Complaint against Snyder alleges that he prepared, reviewed, and signed a materially false or misleading Form 10-Q that WMI filed with the Commission for the first quarter ended March 31, 1999, even though he knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that it failed to disclose that WMIs reported pretax income for that quarter included tens of millions of dollars of non-recurring income items.  The undisclosed income items inflated WMIs EPS by approximately $0.09 or 17%.  The Commissions Complaint further alleges that Snyder sold WMI stock on May 17, 1999, while in possession of the material, nonpublic information that WMIs reported pretax income for the first quarter of fiscal year 1999 included tens of millions of dollars of undisclosed, non-recurring income items.  In addition, the Complaint against Snyder alleges that he sold WMI stock on June 9, 1999, while in possession of material nonpublic information indicating, among other things, WMIs internal earnings projections showed a large shortfall against its second quarter 1999 EPS guidance provided to the investing public.  , According to each of the Commissions Complaints, on July 6, 1999, WMI issued a press release warning that the company had substantially lowered its earnings expectations for the second quarter of 1999 due to a $250 million shortfall in revenues.  The company stated that it expected second quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.67 to $0.70, compared to its previous earnings per share guidance of $0.78 to $0.82.  The Complaint alleges that, in reaction to this news, WMIs stock price dropped 37% from $53.56 per share to $33.94 per share.  , Proto and DeFrates, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions Complaint, each consented to an order permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.  In addition, Proto and DeFrates consented to an order barring each of them, respectively, from serving as an officer or director of a public company for a period of five years.  , Proto has consented to pay a total of $3,721,177.  This amount represents:  (1) $1,503,670 in disgorgement of his illegal insider trading losses avoided, plus prejudgment interest of $513,837; (2) a civil penalty equal to his illegal insider trading losses avoided of $1,503,670; and (3) a $200,000 civil penalty for making materially false or misleading statements regarding WMIs first quarter 1999 earnings and WMIs ability to meet its previously announced second quarter 1999 earnings guidance.  DeFrates has consented to pay a total of $482,779.  This amount represents:  (1) $121,217 in disgorgement of his illegal insider trading losses avoided, plus prejudgment interest of $40,345; (2) a civil penalty equal to his losses avoided of $121,217; and (3) a $200,000 civil penalty for making materially false or misleading statements regarding WMIs first quarter 1999 earnings and WMIs ability to meet its previously announced second quarter 1999 earnings guidance.   , The Commissions Complaint against Snyder seeks an order enjoining him from further violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and from aiding and abetting violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13.

The defendants are Shoreline Development Co., a Delaware company that was headquartered in Costa Mesa, California; Todd J. Taylor, 37; Derek K. Gradwell, 30; Paul A. Barrios III, 42; and Dennis P. OConnell, Jr., 31, all of Orange County, California.  Taylor and Barrios were repeat securities law violators.  In 1999, in a prior case brought by the Commission, Taylor was ordered by a federal district court not to sell securities without registering with the Commission as a broker-dealer.  In 2000, Barrios was the subject of a cease-and-desist order issued by the Commission suspending him for twelve months from association with any broker or dealer. , In its complaint, the Commission alleged that during the offering, Shoreline, Taylor and Gradwell made misrepresentations about the performance of Shorelines wells, a purported business relationship with El Paso Field Services, and their use of investor funds.  These defendants concealed their misappropriation from investors of more than $1.2 million to pay for lavish vacations, a wedding and honeymoon, a vacation home, gambling debts, customized motorcycles and other luxury items., Previously, the district court appointed a receiver to take control of Shoreline for the benefit of investors.  The district court entered a final judgment of permanent injunction against Shoreline, pursuant to consent, enjoining it from violating the antifraud and the securities registration provisions.  The judgment ordered Shoreline to pay in disgorgement $5,005,499.25, the amount raised from investors, including prejudgment interest.  As part of the settlement, Shoreline did not admit or deny the Commissions allegations.  The receiver is in the process of collecting Shorelines assets, the net proceeds of which will be distributed to investors pursuant to a plan approved at a later date by the district court.        , The Commission also obtained a final judgment of permanent injunction enjoining Taylor and Gradwell from committing securities fraud in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and from violating the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.  Taylor and Gradwell were each ordered to pay a penalty in the amount of $120,000.    , The final judgment of permanent injunction also enjoins Barrios and OConnell from violating the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act and from committing violations of the broker-dealer registration provisions of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.  Barrios and OConnell were each ordered to pay a penalty in the amount of $50,000.   , In addition, Taylor and a shell corporation he controlled, Coastal Resources, Inc., were ordered to disgorge the sum of $488,773.99.

Wilson, United States District Judge for the Central District of California, issued orders (1) preliminarily enjoining National Financial Systems, Inc. (NFSI) and Terese Herwick, NFSIs owner and president, from committing securities fraud, and (2) appointing a receiver over NFSI and all of its operations.  NFSI is a Santa Monica, Calif. third-party administrator of retirement plans that also manages an unregistered pool of assets known as the Fixed Fund.  The court authorized the receiver to, among other things, take control of the assets of NFSI, locate and account for any missing assets of NFSI, make an accounting of the assets of NFSI, and employ attorneys to prosecute claims resulting from the activities of NFSI., On September 25, 2003, the Commission filed a complaint alleging that NFSI and Herwick defrauded the Fixed Funds clients and prospective clients by concealing a massive decline in the value of the Fixed Funds assets, by providing clients with false and misleading account statements, and by taking over $1.2 million in undisclosed management fees., More specifically, the Commissions complaint alleges that in 1999, NFSI assumed management of the Fixed Fund, an unregistered pool of assets consisting of real estate, equity securities, mutual funds, and bonds.  Although Herwick knew that a significant number of Fixed Fund assets had not performed for years or had been foreclosed upon, neither NFSI nor Herwick disclosed these facts to the Fixed Funds investors.  In January 2002, NFSI wrote off the worthless assets, another fact that NFSI and Herwick never disclosed to Fixed Fund investors.  The value of the Fixed Funds assets has fallen to approximately 50% of the amount owed to Fixed Fund investors as principal and purported accrued dividends.  As of March 31, 2003, the value of the Fixed Funds assets totaled no more than $7.4 million while the amounts it owed investors in principal and purported accrued returns totaled at least $14.1 million.  NFSI never disclosed this fact to Fund investors either., Instead, the complaint alleges, NFSI continued to promote the Fixed Fund as an investment vehicle that purportedly seeks preservation and protection of capital while providing regular monthly cash distributions.  Moreover, NFSI has provided Fixed Fund investors with quarterly account statements that purport to credit those investors with their contracted-for rates of return -- returns which have not been generated by the Funds underlying assets and which neither the Fund nor NFSI can possibly repay.  In addition, NFSI defrauded the Fixed Fund and its investors by charging the Fixed Fund an undisclosed management fee, which for 2002 constituted more than 10% of the value of the Fixed Funds assets.  In 2002, NFSI took over $700,000 in management fees, while in 2001 it took over $520,000 in fees, none of which was disclosed to investors., The Commissions complaint alleges that NFSI and Herwicks conduct violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The Commissions complaint asks the Court to permanently enjoin NFSI and Herwick from future violations of the foregoing provisions; to order NFSI and Herwick to disgorge, with prejudgment interest, all ill-gotten gains from their illegal conduct; and to pay civil penalties.,  ]"

The Commission further alleges that Friedlander caused the preparation and dissemination of false asset reports that included the unauthorized use of the letterhead of a major accounting firm that had no involvement in the creation of the false asset reports. , Regarding Friedlanders misrepresentations, the amended complaint alleges that Friedlander misled investors in the pooled fund regarding their assets in the fund at the end of 1998, 1999 and 2000.  For 1998, the asset reports forwarded to investors by Friedlander represented total pooled fund assets of more than $3.29 million.  However, the pooled fund had assets of less than $1.86 million.  For 1999, the asset reports forwarded to investors by Friedlander represented total pooled fund assets of more than $4.75 million, when the pooled fund had assets of less than $245,000.  For 2000, the asset reports forwarded to investors by Friedlander represented total pooled fund assets of more than $5.74 million, when the pooled fund had assets of less than $269,000., With regard to conversion, the amended complaint alleges that, starting in at least 1998, Friedlander failed to invest all new money deposited in the pooled fund.  Instead, Friedlander generally commingled money from pooled fund investors with money derived from Friedlanders other activities.  The amended complaint alleges that Friedlander used the commingled money to pay for personal expenses, including country club dues, personal legal fees, maintenance and dockage fees for a sailboat, and condominium fees.  From 1998 through 2001, Friedlander used at least $1.4 million of commingled money for personal expenses, and an additional $879,000 to pay for the operations of his company.  Friedlander also used money from new investments in the pooled fund to repay pooled fund investors who wished to redeem and to pay other individuals for whom he claimed to be managing money.  , The amended complaint also alleges that, from 1996 through 2001, Friedlander provided pooled fund investors with false asset reports, portions of which were on the letterhead of KPMG Peat Marwick LLP.  However, KPMG did not prepare or assist in preparing those asset reports.  KPMG also did not authorize the use of its letterhead, nor did it sign or approve any of these asset reports.  In fact, KPMG had dropped Peat Marwick from its name in late 1998., The Commission filed its original complaint in May 2001, alleging fraud in connection with Friedlanders management of the assets of Friedlander International Limited, an overseas hedge fund.  The Commission alleged that Friedlander inflated the hedge funds net asset value by improperly and arbitrarily valuing certain unlisted securities of a company in which Friedlander and entities he controlled had heavily invested.  The Commissions complaint also alleged that Friedlander engaged in portfolio pumping by purchasing a thinly traded common stock as part of a manipulative scheme to inflate the value of that stock and to inflate the hedge funds net asset value. SEC Litigation Release No. 17021 (June 1, 2001).  These allegations remain unchanged in the amended complaint., In December 2001, Judge Kimba M. Wood granted a preliminary injunction against Friedlander and the related entities.  Judge Wood also appointed a receiver for the entities. SEC Litigation Release No. 17315 (January 15, 2002). , The amended complaint charges that Friedlander and Friedlander Capital Management, based on the allegations described above, violated the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 206 of the Advisers Act).  The Commission seeks permanent injunctive relief against Friedlander and Friedlander Capital Management Corporation, accountings, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil monetary penalties, and other relief., The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation in its investigation of the Office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, which today announced criminal charges against Friedlander in connection with both schemes described in the Commissions amended complaint.

Judge Zobel issued an order on October 9, 2003, requiring Fink to appear for testimony on October 20 and 21, 2003, and as ordered, Fink appeared for testimony on those dates at the Commissions Boston District Office., The Commissions Application alleged that, on June 2, 2003, the Commission served Fink with a subpoena requiring him to appear for testimony on July 1, 2003.  At Finks request, the Commission staff rescheduled Finks testimony for July 16, 2003.  Fink appeared for testimony on July 16; however, his testimony was not completed that day.

Release No. 1908 / October 30, 2003</h2>, <h2><i>SEC v. Sport-Haley, Inc., Robert G. Tomlinson, Steve S. Auger, Kenneth R. LeCrone,</i> Civ. Action No. 03-N-1917 (CBS) (District of Colorado)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced the filing of an Amended Complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado against Kenneth R. LeCrone, former auditor of Sport-Haley, Inc., for violations of the antifraud and periodic reporting provisions of the federal securities laws.  Sport-Haley, located in Denver, Colorado, designs, markets, and contracts for the manufacture of golf apparel and outerwear under the Haley-Registered Trademark label.  According to the Amended Complaint, LeCrone, a certified public accountant formerly employed by the audit firm of Levine, Hughes, and Mithuen, Inc. (LHM), supervised LHMs 1998 and 1999 audits of Sport-Haley, serving as the in-charge staff accountant in 1998 and senior manager in 1999.  The Commission alleges that LeCrone permitted LHM to issue unqualified audit opinions on Sport-Haleys financial statements even though he knew or was reckless in not knowing that the companys quarterly and annual 1998, 1999, and first quarter 2000 financial statements materially misstated work-in-process (WIP) inventory, improperly capitalize period costs and materially misstated losses on the sale of headwear equipment., The Commissions complaint alleges that Sport-Haley materially overstated WIP inventory in its financial statements during its 1998 and 1999 fiscal years.  The complaint further alleges that LeCrone knew or was reckless in not knowing that LHM failed to perform sufficient audit procedures on the companys 1998 and 1999 WIP inventory accounts.  According to the Amended Complaint, LeCrone agreed with Sport-Haley management to a solution to adjust the overstated WIP inventory account that minimized the impact on the companys gross margin, kept the 1998 financial statements intact, and ratably eliminated $1.2 million of overstated WIP inventory during the companys 2000 fiscal year.  The Commission alleges that Sport-Haley failed to disclose the WIP inventory overstatement or the companys measures to adjust the financial statements for the overstatement.  According to the Amended Complaint, LeCrone also recklessly allowed Sport-Haley to improperly capitalize period costs in financial statements filed with the Commission during its 1998 and 1999 fiscal years.  In addition, the Commission alleges that LeCrone knowingly or recklessly allowed the company to materially misstate losses on the sale of headwear equipment in Sport-Haleys 1999 year-end financial statements.  The Complaint asserts that LeCrone knew or was reckless in not knowing that Sport-Haleys financial statements were materially false or misleading, did not comply with generally accepted accounting principles, and that the audits were not performed in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards., According to the Complaint, as a result of these and other accounting errors, Sport-Haley filed with the Commission materially incorrect financial statements that overstated the companys 1998 fiscal year income by $1.5 million or 41 percent and its 1999 fiscal year income by $311,000 or 22 percent., As a result of the conduct described in the Complaint, the Commission charged LeCrone with violations of Sections 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) (antifraud provisions).  LeCrone is also charged with aiding and abetting Sport-Haleys violations of Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 15d-1, and 15d-13 thereunder (reporting provisions).  The Commissions Complaint seeks injunctive relief and civil penalties from LeCrone., On September 26, 2003, the Commission filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado against Sport-Haley, its chairman of the board, and former controller for violations of the antifraud, periodic reporting, record keeping, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with the companys materially misstated financial statements., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18437.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Entered Today and Those Originally Proposed</h2>, <h2>Information by Company</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that the Honorable William H. Pauley III, United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York, issued an Order approving the $1.4 billion global settlement of the SEC enforcement actions against ten of the nations top investment firms and two individuals alleging undue influence of investment banking interests on securities research at brokerage firms., In addition to the Order, which applies to all 12 actions that are part of the global settlement, the Court also entered separate Final Judgments as to each of the 12 defendants, Orders Regarding Distribution Fund Plan as to nine of the investment firms and Orders Regarding Investor Education as to seven of the firms.  The Orders Regarding Distribution Fund Plan provide further details as to investors who may be eligible to receive proceeds from the Distribution Funds to be created as part of the global settlement.  The Orders Regarding Investor Education set forth a framework and guidelines for the formation of a non-profit grant administration organization to fund worthy and cost-efficient programs designed to equip investors with the knowledge and skills necessary to make informed investment decisions., The SEC filed its Complaints, the defendants consents and proposed judgments on April 28, 2003.  In its Complaints, the allegations of which the defendants neither admit nor deny, the SEC alleged that, from approximately mid-1999 through mid-2001 or later, all of the firms engaged in acts and practices that created or maintained inappropriate influence by investment banking over research analysts, thereby imposing conflicts of interest on research analysts that the firms failed to manage in an adequate or appropriate manner.  The Complaints also alleged supervisory deficiencies at every firm., In addition to these allegations, the Complaints included additional charges specific to each firm.  According to the Complaints:, The Complaint against Grubman alleged that Grubman, a former SSB research analyst covering the telecommunications sector, issued research reports that were fraudulent, misleading, or that were  not based on principles of fair dealing and good faith and did not provide a sound basis for evaluating facts, contained exaggerated or unwarranted claims about the companies, and/or contained opinions for which there was no reasonable basis under SSBs name.  As a result, the Complaint alleges, Grubman aided and abetted SSBs violations of Section 15(c) of the Exchange Act and Rule 15c1-2 thereunder, which are antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws relating to broker-dealers, and violated NASD and NYSE rules as well as New York State law., The Complaint against Blodget alleged that Blodget issued fraudulent research under the name of his former employer, Merrill Lynch, as well as research in which he expressed views that were inconsistent with privately expressed negative views.  As a result, the Complaint alleges, Blodget aided and abetted Merrill Lynchs violations of Section 15(c) of the Exchange Act and Rule 15c1-2 thereunder  and violated  NASD and NYSE rules., The Final Judgments, Orders Regarding Distribution Fund Plan and Orders Regarding Investor Education entered today are substantially similar to the final judgments originally submitted to the Court.  In particular, they impose the identical injunctive relief and monetary sanctions, and they impose the same requirements regarding separation of research and banking, disclosure, transparency and independent research., Under the terms of the Final Judgments and Orders that Judge Pauley approved today, the ten firms, Grubman and Blodget will pay a total of $894 million in penalties and disgorgement, consisting of $397 million in disgorgement and $497 million in penalties (which includes Merrill Lynchs previous payment of $100 million in connection with its prior settlement with the states relating to research analyst conflicts of interest).  Half of the $775 million payment by the firms other than Merrill Lynch will be paid in resolution of actions brought by the SEC, NYSE and NASD  and will be put into Distribution Funds to benefit customers of those firms.  Half of Grubmans $15 million total payment will be added to the SSB Distribution Fund.  The SEC will in the future propose a plan of distribution for Blodgets $4 million payment; that plan must be approved by the Court.  The remainder of the funds has been paid or will be paid to the states., In addition, the Final Judgments require the firms to make payments totaling $432.5 million to fund independent research.  Further, seven of the firms will make payments of $80 million to fund and promote investor education.  $52.5 million of these funds will be put into an Investor Education Fund that will develop and support programs designed to equip investors with the knowledge and skills necessary to make informed decisions. The remaining $27.5 million will be paid to state securities regulators and used for investor education purposes., In addition to the monetary payments, the firms are required to undertake dramatic reforms to their future practices, including separating their research and investment banking departments and making independent research available to investors.  Among other significant reforms included in the Final Judgments as to the firms are the following:, There are four primary differences between the Final Judgments and Orders entered today and the original proposed judgments.  First, the Orders Regarding Distribution Fund Plan provide further details as to investors who may be eligible to receive proceeds from the Distribution Funds.  The Final Judgments for each firm (other than Merrill Lynch) state that, to be an eligible recipient from that firms Distribution Fund, a person must have purchased equity securities in question through that firm during the relevant period of purchase.  The Orders Regarding Distribution Fund Plan list the specific equity securities in question for each firm and the relevant period of purchase for each such equity security.  The Orders state that the identification of equity securities in question and relevant periods of purchase is solely for the purpose of facilitating the efficient administration of the Distribution Fund Plans, is not a judicial or Commission finding, and is not intended to have precedential effect in other actions., Second, the Orders Regarding Investor Education call for the establishment of a new Investor Education Entity, which may remain in existence for an indefinite period.  As mentioned above, the Investor Education Entity will fund worthy and cost-efficient programs from the Investor Education Fund created as a result of the firms investor education payments.  These programs will be designed to equip investors with the knowledge and skills necessary to make informed investment decisions.  The Investor Education Entity will be organized as a tax exempt organization pursuant to Section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code and will be structured so that it can receive additional money from sources other than the investor education payments that the firms are required to make under the Final Judgments.  The Entity will have a Chairman, a Board of Directors and an Executive Director, who will oversee its day-to-day operations.  Within the next 90 days, the Commission will propose an Investor Education Plan that will, among other things, provide further details on the structure and operation of the Investor Education Entity., Third, the Final Judgments require the defendants to make their Distribution Fund and investor education payments to accounts established at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRB-NY).  The original proposed judgments had called for those payments to be made to the Court Registry Investment System (CRIS).  As the Court pointed out in its June 2, 2003 Order in these actions, however, an affiliate of one of the defendants manages the CRIS accounts for the U.S. Courts and derives certain fees for its activities, thus creating a potential conflict of interest.  Accordingly, the Court suggested, and the parties agreed to, the establishment of accounts at the FRB-NY., Fourth, the Final Judgments call for a smaller administrative fee to be paid to the Court Clerk than did the original proposed judgments.  This will allow more money to be provided to investors.  Federal law requires court registry funds, such as the Distribution Funds, to pay a fee usually equal to ten percent of the income earned on the funds to the Court Clerk.  The Court suggested that the Commission petition the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AOUSC) for a reduction in the fee.  The Commission did so, and the AOUSC approved a reduction in the fee for the Distribution Funds to four percent of the income earned on the funds.  The Final Judgments reflect this reduction., <p align=center><img alt=* border=0 height=9 src=/images/dot_orange.gif width=6/> <img alt=* border=0 height=9 src=/images/dot_orange.gif width=6/> <img alt=* border=0 height=9 src=/images/dot_orange.gif width=6/> <img alt=* border=0 height=9 src=/images/dot_orange.gif width=6/> <img alt=* border=0 height=9 src=/images/dot_orange.gif width=6/>, The Commission acknowledges the assistance of NASD, NYSE, and state securities regulators in the investigation of this matter., <i>See also:</i> <a href=/spotlight/globalsettlement.htm>Spotlight on: The Global Research Analyst Settlement</a>,  ]"

Fla.)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that on October 31, 2003, a jury returned a guilty verdict in a criminal case against Paul R. Johnson.  The SEC had previously brought a civil case against Johnson, alleging that he and other defendants had illegally raised over $15.5 million from nearly 400 investors for Link Express Delivery Solutions, Inc. (Link Express). During the time of his misconduct, Johnson was the president and CEO of Link Express., The United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Florida (USAO) brought criminal charges against Johnson, and another defendant John Cook, following a coordinated investigation with the SEC, the FBI, the IRS, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the Florida Department of Banking and Finance.  Among other things, the indictment charged Johnson with conspiracy to commit securities fraud, securities fraud, and money laundering.  The indictment also charged Johnson with perjury for making false declarations during a hearing to freeze assets in the SECs case against him., The indictment charged Johnson with fraudulently raising funds for Link Express, and charged him with inducing investors to purchase stock by falsely representing that all funds raised would be used for operating, acquisition, and administrative expenses associated with Link Express package delivery service.  Instead, Johnson actually used the money for himself, his close friends and relatives, and his own personal ventures.  The SECs complaint in Securities and Exchange Commission v. Paul R. Johnson, et al., Case No. 01-7874-CIV-Hurley (S.D. Fla., filed December 12, 2001), is based on the same misconduct described in the USAOs indictment. , The jury found Johnson guilty after an eight week trial conducted by the USAO with assistance from the SEC.

Elzein was ordered to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest and a civil penalty in amounts to be resolved upon motion of the Commission at a later date.  Elzein consented to the entry of the order without admitting or denying any of the allegations of the Commissions complaint., The Commissions complaint alleged that Elzein, Hussein El Zein (H. El Zein) and Darin Knee (Knee), from approximately July through October 2001, raised approximately $541,000 from investors in a fraudulent, unregistered offering of securities in the form of investment contracts.  The defendants made materially false and misleading statements and omissions in connection with the offers and sales of the investment contracts including, among other things, false historical returns, and promised returns without a reasonable basis therefor. Also, the complaint alleged that the private placement memorandum utilized by the defendants inaccurately stated that Focus Mentors was fully insured by Allstate Insurance Company, such that the assets of Focus Mentors were protected in the unlikely case that Focus Mentors or its executives were to declare bankruptcy and falsely stated that each clients principal investment was protected in the case of acts of dishonesty.  These statements were false because Focus Mentors did not have such insurance.  The complaint further alleged that Knee promoted Focus Mentors on his MoneyJoe.com website and in his related electronic newsletter called Insiders Club.  Among other things, the complaint alleged that Knees website described Focus Mentors as a secure opportunity with 107% plus principal guaranteed even though Knee had no reasonable basis for such statements. , See also <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18324.htm>L.

(filed May 8, 2001)</h2>]","[On October 31, 2003, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Jorge Eduardo Ballesteros Franco (Jorge Ballesteros), the former Chairman of Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo, S.A., a major Mexican construction company, based upon charges of insider trading.  The Commissions Complaint, filed on May 8, 2001, and amended on May 16, 2002, alleges that Jorge Ballesteros received a tip from his brother, the late Jose Luis Ballesteros, who was then a director of Nalco Chemical Company (Nalco).  The Complaint alleges that Jorge Ballesteros was tipped about a possible acquisition of Nalco prior to the June 28, 1999 public announcement that Nalco would be acquired by Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux, S.A., (Suez).  Following the tip, Jorge Ballesteros placed orders to purchase over $5.7 million in Nalco stock through Swiss accounts controlled by offshore trusts and nominee companies, resulting in illegal profits of over $2 million., The Commissions Complaint specifically alleges that Jose Luis Ballesteros attended a June 17, 1999 Nalco board meeting at which he learned that Nalco had received a conditional takeover offer from Suez.  The Complaint alleges that by June 21, 1999, Jose Luis Ballesteros tipped his brother, Jorge Ballesteros, regarding the offer from Suez.  Between June 22 and June 25, 1999, Jorge Ballesteros then directed the purchase of 153,300 Nalco shares through two offshore companies, Gianni Enterprises Limited and Sagitton Limited.  Those companies, in turn, were owned by two family trusts, Gianni Trust, whose settlor is Jorge Ballesteros mother, and Cardinal Trust, whose settlor is his wife.  After the June 28, 1999 public announcement, Jorge Ballesteros directed that the Nalco stock be sold, resulting in illegal profits of $2,271,108.55., Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions Complaint, Jorge Ballesteros consented to the entry of the Courts final judgment.  The judgment orders him to pay a penalty of $2,573,875.  This amount represents a one-time penalty on the illegal profits made in the Gianni Enterprises Limited account and a two-time penalty on the illegal profits made in the Sagitton Limited account.  The Commission intends to have these funds paid into a court account pursuant to the Fair Fund provisions of Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for ultimate distribution to victims of the fraud.  In addition, the judgment permanently enjoins Jorge Ballesteros from violating Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder.  All of the profits, along with prejudgment interest, were previously paid as part of a settlement with other parties announced on May 8, 2001.  SEC v.

In light of this current settlement with Jorge Ballesteros, and the prior settlement with the estate of Jose Luis Ballesteros in 2001, the Commission has filed a notice voluntarily dismissing its claims against the corporate and trust vehicles through which Jorge Ballesteros traded.  , All told, the Commission has now obtained over $10 million in settlements from the 20 defendants charged with insider trading in Nalco stock.  In addition to the Commissions May 8, 2001 Complaint, the Commission filed two additional settled actions arising out of trading in the securities of Nalco.  SEC v.

AmeriCredit Corp.,</i> Civil Action No. 3:03-CV-2674-L (USDC/N.D.Tex.)</h2>]","[On November 3, 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed an insider trading case, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, against five present or former officials of Fort Worth-based AmeriCredit Corp., including a senior vice president, a former senior vice president, a former vice president, and two former assistant vice presidents.  Those individuals have agreed to pay, in the aggregate, over $400,000 to settle the SECs claims against them.  The SEC simultaneously filed an action seeking a civil money penalty against AmeriCredit as a control person, on the grounds that AmeriCredit failed to take appropriate steps to prevent an illegal trade by one of its employees, when the company had information showing that the employee had previously traded in the companys stock based on inside information.  AmeriCredit has agreed to pay $100,000 to settle the SECs claims against the company., Named in the first action above are: senior vice president John R. Gentry, III, of Stanley, North Carolina; former senior vice president James M. Adelt, of Grapevine, Texas; former vice president Michael W. Morris, of Fort Worth, Texas; and former assistant vice presidents Keith A. Cyr, of Mansfield, Texas, and Thomas M. Laker, of Fort Worth, Texas.  AmeriCredit, the defendant in the second action, is a New York Stock Exchange traded company in the business of purchasing finance contracts from automobile dealers and making loans directly to consumers for purchases of new and used cars. , In its complaint against the individual defendants, the SEC alleges that, in the ordinary course of their duties at AmeriCredit, the individual defendants obtained material nonpublic information about AmeriCredits financial performance for the quarter ending December 31, 2001, and based on that information, each of them sold AmeriCredit stock between January 2 and January 10, 2002, prior to publication of the information in a January 10, 2002 AmeriCredit earnings announcement.  Specifically, according to the SEC, the individual defendants learned about unfavorable collection results for the quarter ending December 31, 2001, such as the fact that the rate at which AmeriCredit charged off delinquent accounts, and the percentage of AmeriCredit accounts that were more than 60 days overdue, were substantially greater than in the same quarter a year earlier.  Following the public release of that information on January 10, 2002, the price of AmeriCredits stock declined.  The SEC alleges that the AmeriCredit employees who sold shares before publication of the information fraudulently avoided losses that they would have experienced if they had sold the stock after the market reacted to the January 10 announcement; and one employee who sold the stock short before the announcement earned illegal trading profits.  The SEC alleges that each individual defendant breached a duty of trust and confidence that he owed AmeriCredits shareholders, by selling AmeriCredit shares based on the material nonpublic information.  The SECs complaint alleges that the individual AmeriCredit employees thereby violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., In its complaint against AmeriCredit, the SEC alleges that the company directly or indirectly controlled Keith Cyr, one of the employees who engaged in insider trading; that the company knew or recklessly disregarded the fact that Cyr was likely to trade in the companys stock while he was in possession of material nonpublic information; and that the company failed to take appropriate steps to prevent Cyr from trading in the companys stock while he had material nonpublic information.  Specifically, the SEC claims that AmeriCredit knew about, or recklessly disregarded, a sale of AmeriCredit shares that Cyr made on January 2, 2002, through a brokerage account that AmeriCredit set up for Cyr and monitored in connection with AmeriCredits employee stock option program.  The SEC further alleges that, on January 2, AmeriCredit knew or recklessly disregarded the fact that Cyr had material nonpublic information, because the company made that information available to Cyr for his use in the ordinary course of his duties.  According to the SEC, because the company knew or recklessly disregarded, on January 2, that Cyr traded in the companys stock, and also that Cyr had material nonpublic information, the company knew or recklessly disregarded the fact that Cyr was likely to trade in the companys stock, at a later date, while in possession of material nonpublic information.  The SEC alleges that, on January 4, Cyr again traded in the companys stock while he was in possession of material nonpublic information, in violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and because AmeriCredit did not take appropriate steps to prevent Cyrs illegal trade on January 4, the company is liable for a civil money penalty under the control person provision of Section 21A of the Exchange Act., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, each of the individual defendants has made, and the Commission has accepted, an offer of settlement in which each defendant consents: to the entry of a permanent injunction enjoining them from further violations of the above provisions of the federal securities laws; to disgorgement of their illicit profits or losses avoided, plus prejudgment interest; and to payment of a civil money penalty equal to the amount of their illicit profits or losses avoided.  Pursuant to those settlement offers, Laker will disgorge $110,172 in illicit profits, plus prejudgment interest of $7,642, and pay a civil money penalty of $110,172; Gentry will disgorge $43,600 in losses avoided, plus prejudgment interest of $2,831, and a pay a civil money penalty of $43,600; Adelt will disgorge $41,763 in losses avoided, plus prejudgment interest of $2,711, and pay a civil money penalty of $41,763; Morris will disgorge $11,016 in losses avoided, plus prejudgment interest of $715, and pay a civil money penalty of $11,016; and Cyr will disgorge $10,393 in losses avoided, plus prejudgment interest of $674, and pay a civil money penalty of $10,393.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, AmeriCredit has made, and the Commission has accepted, an offer of settlement pursuant to which AmeriCredit will pay a civil money penalty of $100,000., The SEC staff gratefully acknowledges the assistance of the New York Stock Exchange in the investigation of the facts leading to this action., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18442.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a> (Americredit Corp.), <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18442a.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a> (James M.

Henderson, et al.</i> (U.S.D.C., Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division, Civil Action No. 3-03-CV-2661-K)</h2>]","[On October 31, 2003, the Commission filed an emergency action in United States District Court in Dallas, Texas, charging David B. Henderson, Independent Funding, Inc., Independent Funding Ltd./Nevada, and Jess L. Mercer with securities fraud in connection with an unregistered interstate offering and sale of $2 million in notes, largely to unsophisticated elderly investors.  United States District Judge Ed Kinkeade entered a temporary restraining order halting the offering, and also issued orders to conserve assets for the benefit of the schemes victims, including an asset freeze and an accounting., Named as defendants are:, The Commission also named in its complaint as relief defendants, seeking return of investor funds unjustly received, the following entities and individuals:, The Commission alleges that David Henderson, his companies, and Mercer sold, and are selling, the notes using false, misleading and materially incomplete offering materials.  For example, according to the complaint, the offering materials represent that note proceeds will be used to purchase secured automobile loans from third parties, and that these loans will secure the notes. The materials further promise that the notes are safe and liquid, and claim that they are not securities. Mercer, the complaint asserts, parrots these claims to his investors and then goes a step farther, describing the notes as risk free and guaranteed., The Commission contends, however, that these representations are false.  The Complaint alleges that, rather than purchase automobile loans, David Henderson and his companies primarily have used investor funds to, among other things, pay Todd Henderson and his companies large servicing and consulting fees; make loans to Todd Henderson and other third parties; pay personal expenses; and repay the holders of an earlier series of securities Henderson issued in the late 1990s.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Henderson uses funds from new investors to make Ponzi payments to existing investors.  Moreover, the Commission contends that the notes are not risk free or guaranteed but, rather, are fraught with great risks.  None of these matters, the Commission contends, have been disclosed to investors., The Commissions complaint charges David Henderson, Independent Funding, Inc., Independent Funding Limited and Mercer with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Mercer is also charged with violating Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act by acting as an unregistered broker.  The complaint seeks against these defendants a temporary restraining order, preliminary and permanent injunctions, accountings, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, civil money penalties, and, except as to Mercer, asset freezes and the appointment of a receiver. The Commission also seeks asset freezes, disgorgement and accountings from the relief defendants because they were unjustly enriched from the fraudulent offerings.  The complaint also seeks an order prohibiting the destruction of documents and expediting discovery.   , The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Division of Securities of the Utah Department of Commerce, the Idaho Department of Finance and the Arizona Securities Commission., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18443.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18443.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Commission alleges in its complaint that, from at least 2001 through September 2003, former brokers Martin J. Druffner, Justin F. Ficken, Skifter Ajro, John S. Peffer, and Marc J. Bilotti defrauded mutual funds and their shareholders by misrepresenting their identities or the identities of their customers in connection with thousands of market timing trades after the mutual funds had restricted or blocked the defendants or their customers from further trading.  According to the Commissions complaint, former branch manager Robert Shannon substantially assisted the brokers in their violations by, among other things, approving their market timing trades.  Until September 2003, the defendants worked at a Prudential Securities branch in Boston, Massachusetts., According to the Commissions complaint, filed in federal district court in Boston, from at least 2001 through September 2003, numerous mutual fund companies blocked the defendants or their brokerage customers from further trading in their funds after the mutual fund companies detected market timing activity by the defendants.  The complaint alleges that, to evade these blocks, the defendants concealed their own identities by using multiple broker identification numbers or concealed the identities of their brokerage customers by establishing additional brokerage accounts at Prudential Securities on behalf of the customers., The Commissions complaint alleges that Druffner, Ficken, Ajro, Peffer, and Bilotti violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and violated or aided and abetted violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Muth and Door Chair, Ltd., Civil Action No. 03 CV 2178 WQH (JFS).  (S.D.Cal., filed November 5, 2003), On November 5, 2003, the Commission filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California against Steven E. Muth alleging that Muth perpetrated a fraudulent scheme to artificially inflate the stock price of San Diego-based airport concessionaire Creative Host Services, Inc. from $0.78 to $29.00, an increase of 3,618%.  Muth, 43, of Houston, Texas, was employed as a registered representative of broker-dealer Kirkpatrick, Pettis, Smith, Polian Inc., headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska., The complaint alleges that Muth fraudulently manipulated Creative Hosts stock price during the period November 1999 to June 2000 by restricting supply and artificially creating demand for the stock through a variety of techniques and devices.  These included:  1) causing Kirkpatricks clients to buy and control 90% of Creative Hosts shares; 2) engaging in high-pressure sales tactics; 3) using Kirkpatricks affiliation with Mutual of Omaha Insurance Company to gain client trust; 4) refusing to execute clients orders to sell Creative Host shares; 5) encouraging customers to obtain credit on their Creative Host shares in order to release funds with which to buy additional shares without explaining the risks of that credit; 6) hiring promoters to tout the shares on the Internet;  7) delaying submission of client orders toward the end of the trading day to increase demand at the end of the day; 8) helping  Kirkpatrick to lead the bid prices placed for Creative Host shares, and 9) orchestrating prearranged trades.  As a result of these actions, Muth allegedly received $950,562 in ill-gotten commissions and $546,781 in ill-gotten trading profits, $463,030 of which was received through Door Chair, Ltd., an entity Muth controls.  The Commission charged Muth with securities fraud, specifically violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., Separately, on November 5, 2003, the Commission entered an Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings, Making Findings, And Imposing Remedial Sanctions Pursuant To Section 15(b) Of The Securities Exchange Act Of 1934 (Order) against Kirkpatrick; Peter N. Lahti, Kirkpatricks former Chairman, President and CEO; and Gregory D. Adams, Kirkpatricks former branch manager of two Colorado branch offices, for failure to supervise.  While neither admitting or denying the Orders findings, Kirkpatrick, Lahti, 59, of Omaha, Nebraska, and Adams, 49, of Gulf Breeze, Florida, consented to the entry of the Order., The Commissions Order found that Lahti failed to develop an adequate system to implement Kirkpatricks procedures to prevent and detect securities law violations.  Additionally, Lahti and Adams disregarded red flags indicating suspicious conduct related to the manipulation of Creative Hosts share price.  Adams also failed to follow Kirkpatricks policies and procedures regarding heightened supervision and review of correspondence.  As part of their offers to settle the Commissions administrative proceeding, Kirkpatrick agreed to a censure; Lahti agreed to be suspended from acting in a supervisory capacity at a broker-dealer for 12 months; and Adams agreed to be suspended from association with any broker-dealer for six months and barred from acting in a supervisory capacity at a broker-dealer.  In addition the Order imposes a $100,000 penalty against Kirkpatrick, a $40,000 penalty against Lahti, and a $20,000 penalty against Adams., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18447.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a> (in <a href=/about/acrobat.htm>PDF</a> format), <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18447.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Kern, of Weston, Florida, Donald R. Kern, of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and Charles Wilkins, of Scottsdale, Arizona, had engaged in fraud and deceit by participating in a market manipulation that resulted in millions of dollars in losses to unwitting investors, and could not have occurred but for defendants active involvement and knowledge.  In a Final Judgment entered on October 2, 2003, the Court enjoined Richard Kern, Donald Kern, and Charles Wilkins, and three entities, EFI Corp., Barclay Bankcard, Inc., and Canyon Vista Corp., from violating Section 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act of 1933.  Defendants Richard Kern, Donald Kern, and Charles Wilkins previously had consented, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, to an injunction prohibiting them from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., The Court ordered Richard Kern, Donald Kern, and Charles Wilkins to pay disgorgement of almost $6 million, plus prejudgment interest of about $1.7 million, jointly and severally with EFI Corp., Barclay Bankcard, Inc., and Canyon Vista Corp.  The Court ordered relief defendants Hannah R Trust and Hannah G Irrevocable Trust to pay disgorgement of almost $1 million, plus prejudgment interest of approximately $280,000.  The Court also ordered Richard and Donald Kern to pay a civil penalty of $400,000 each, and ordered Charles Wilkins to pay a $300,000 civil penalty.  When determining whether to impose the penalties, the Court considered, among other things, the individuals lack of cooperation with the SEC with respect to the diminution of assets - the proceeds of illegal activities - that were frozen pursuant to an Order of this Court on July 6, 2000., The Commissions complaint, filed on February 24, 2000, alleged that the Kerns and Wilkins aided and abetted co-defendant Peter C. Lybrand in a stock manipulation and that the Kerns and Wilkins made unregistered sales of the securities of three shell corporations:  Polus, Inc., Citron, Inc., and Electronic Transfer Associates, Inc. (ETA).  Lybrand, formerly known as Peter C. Tosto, was enjoined by the Court in this case in March 2002, and is serving an 87-month prison sentence for crimes he committed in connection with the manipulation, among other things.  The complaint alleged that beginning in March 1998, Lybrand arranged to acquire Polus, Citron, and ETA from the Kerns and Wilkins, who controlled virtually all of the issued and outstanding shares of the shell corporations.  Instead of collecting their sale price directly from Lybrand, the complaint alleged that the Kerns and Wilkins agreed to accumulate their sale price by selling a small percentage of their shares into the public market.  Since there was not an active trading market for the securities, Lybrand created an artificial market by orchestrating a series of matched trades in which the Kerns and Wilkins sold their shares to other parties at prices fixed by Lybrand.  The complaint further alleged that Lybrand also created interest in the stocks by issuing misleading press releases.  Lybrands manipulation of the securities market caused the stock prices of each corporation to increase dramatically.  Finally, the complaint alleged that after the Kerns and Wilkins had accumulated their sale price, they transferred to Lybrand the balance of the shares that they owed him and then continued to sell their remaining shares into the market at artificially inflated prices, realizing total illegal profits of about $6 million before the Commission suspended trading in the securities on January 29, 1999., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of NASD Regulation, Inc., in this matter.

Ballinger (Ballinger), 55, Dennis R. Weaver (Weaver), 54, of Jackson, Tennessee, Kosta S. Kovachev (Kovachev), 51, of Lake Worth, Florida, Lee E. Larscheid (Larscheid), 54, of Branson, Missouri, Benny G. Morris (Morris), 46, of Palm Harbor, Florida, Darin W. Roberts (Roberts), 29, of Branson, Missouri, Linda M. Sears (Sears), 50, of Seminole, Florida, Todd R. Walker (Walker), 44, of Tampa, Florida, Missouri-based Ozark Ticket and Travel, Inc. (Ozark Ticket) and Nevada-based Universal Financial Leasing, Inc. (Universal Leasing) (collectively, the Defendants) offered and sold securities nominally structured as hotel timeshare rental interests (units).        , The Commissions Complaint also alleged that Branson City and Resort Hotels main principals, Ballinger and Weaver, prepared fraudulent promotional materials.  With the assistance of Kovachev, Roberts, Sears, and Walker, who are all Branson City or Resort Hotels principals or agents, Ballinger and Weaver distributed these fraudulent promotional materials to sales agents and otherwise promoted Branson City and Resort Hotels to an extensive sales network.  This sales network was recruited and trained primarily by Morris, through Morris company, Universal Leasing, both of whom acted as unregistered broker-dealers.  Among other things, Morris and Universal Leasing distributed these fraudulent offering materials to the sales network for use in the solicitation of investors.  Morris, at times through Universal Leasing, was paid a commission on every sale, and Roberts was paid a commission on sales by sales agents he recruited.  Morris (at times, through Universal Leasing) and Sears processed new investor documentation, and handled new investors funds.  From at least September 2000 to the present, through this sales network, Branson City and Resort Hotels have collectively raised at least $28 million from at least 600 investors in 30 states. , In the process, Branson City and Resort Hotels, through the other Defendants and the sales network, misrepresented and omitted to state material facts in offering materials distributed to the sales network, which the sales force passed along orally and in writing to investors.  The Defendants repeatedly confirmed these misstatements and omissions, including, among other things, that: (1) the proceeds of their offerings would be used to purchase and refurbish resort properties; and (2) investor returns would be derived from subleasing of the investors timeshare units by third party subleasing agents.  However, from at least September 2001 to at least August 2003, investors returns were, in fact, generated with new investors money, and transferred to existing investors primarily by Ozark Ticket, a subleasing agent to which Branson City and Resort Hotels, through their principals and agents, including the sales network, steered most investors.  Ozark Ticket and its owner, Larscheid, have actively assisted the other Defendants to defraud investors.  Specifically, from at least July 2001 to at least July 2003, Ozark Ticket sent investors sample subleasing agreements that included monthly income payment schedules to lead investors to believe that they would receive annualized returns of at least 11% derived from Ozark Tickets subleasing of their units.  In fact, there is no meaningful subleasing activity.  Instead, since at least September 2001, Branson City and Resort Hotels have transferred new investors money to existing investors (via Ozark Ticket) to mislead them into believing their investments were profitable.   , The Commissions Complaint also alleged that there is a significant risk that investor assets in the accounts of the Defendants may be dissipated.  Specifically, the Defendants have used and are using investor funds for their own purposes, and using the same bank account where investor funds are deposited to pay themselves (including their business and personal expenses) and others.  In addition, in early October 2003, Ozark Ticket informed Branson City and Resort Hotels investors whose units it claims to be servicing, that it was suspending income payments to them because the program is in jeopardy due to the SECs investigation.  Furthermore, Ballinger, Larscheid, and Sears are convicted felons, and Weaver has a disciplinary history.  Morris and Kovachev have also refused to answer the staffs questions based on their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination, including questions about their roles in the schemes, and their use and disposition of investor assets., The Commissions Complaint seeks:  (1) a temporary restraining order, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, and disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest, against Branson City and Resort Hotels, based on their violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder; (2) a temporary restraining order, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty against Ballinger, Kovachev, Larscheid, Ozark Ticket, Sears, Walker, Weaver, based on their violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder; (3) a temporary restraining order, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief,  disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest, plus a civil penalty against  Morris, Roberts, and Universal Leasing based on their violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act, and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Exchange, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder; and (4) ancillary relief against all of the defendants, including: expedited discovery, an accounting, asset freezes, an order prohibiting the destruction, mutilation, concealment, alteration or disposition of books and records, and, if necessary, the appointment of a receiver.  , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18450.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18450.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Because WorldCom was in bankruptcy reorganization, the SECs settlement of its claims for civil penalties was reviewed and approved by both the District Court and the Bankruptcy Court.  (Litigation Releases Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18219.htm>18219</a> and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18277.htm>18277</a>)., The SECs civil penalty judgment against WorldCom provided that WorldCom was liable for a civil penalty in the amount of $2,250,000,000.  It further provided that, in the event of confirmation of a plan of reorganization of WorldCom by the Bankruptcy Court  which occurred on October 31, 2003  WorldComs obligation to the SEC shall be satisfied by the companys payment of $500,000,000 in cash and its transfer of common stock in the reorganized company having a value of $250,000,000, on the effective date of its plan of reorganization.  Under the terms of the settlement, the funds paid and the common stock transferred by WorldCom to satisfy the SECs judgment will be distributed to investor victims of the companys fraud, pursuant to Section 308 (Fair Funds for Investors) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  Additional information regarding the Fair Fund distribution of WorldComs civil penalty is available on the Commissions website., The Commissions investigation into the events surrounding the WorldCom fraud is continuing.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18451.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Fahey, former president of San Antonio-based InverWorld, Inc. and InverWorld Securities, Inc.  On August 4, 1999, the SEC charged Fahey and Jose P. Zollino, InverWorlds former chairman, with losing in excess of $400 million of client funds in unauthorized, highly leveraged securities investments and practically worthless securities issued by foreign shell companies.  The SEC civil action was stayed pending a criminal investigation into the same conduct by the United States Attorney for the Western District of Texas (San Antonio Division). , On December 14, 2001, Fahey pleaded guilty to two counts of investment adviser fraud and conspiracy to launder money.  In March 2003, the court sentenced Fahey to 84 months imprisonment and ordered him to pay criminal restitution of $139 million.  On May 13, 2002, Zollino pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to commit fraud and launder money.  In October 2002, Zollino was sentenced to 144 months imprisonment and ordered to pay $341 million in criminal restitution.  , Fahey, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint, has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  In light of his jail sentence and criminal restitution order, which is in an amount greater than the Commissions disgorgement claim, the Commission will forego its claims for disgorgement and a civil penalty.  The judgment enjoins Fahey from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  , Fahey, in a related administrative proceeding, has agreed to consent to a Commission order barring him from association with any broker-dealer or investment advisor. , Additional information can be found in Litigation Release <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr16242.htm>No. 16242</a> (August 4, 1999); <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr16974.htm>No. 16974</a> (April 25, 2001); and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17533.htm>No. 17533</a> (May 24, 2002)., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18452.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

YOUNGDAHL and STEVEN E. NOTHERN</i> (United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Civil Action No. 03-CV-6672 (NRB))</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that John M. Youngdahl, Jr., a former Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. Vice President and Senior Economist, has agreed to settle the Commissions pending insider trading charges against him.  The charges relate to Goldman Sachs purchases of U.S. Treasury 30-year bonds minutes before the Treasury Departments Oct. 31, 2001, announcement that it would no longer issue such bonds.  The Treasury Departments announcement had a dramatic market impact, causing the largest one-day price movement in the 30-year bond since October 1987.  Youngdahl is a resident of Summit, N.J., If the federal district court in Manhattan hearing the SECs civil action approves the settlement, Youngdahl will be permanently enjoined from committing securities fraud, and will pay a civil penalty of $240,000.  In separate proceedings regarding the same conduct, Youngdahl today pled guilty to criminal securities fraud charges brought by the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York., The Commissions complaint, filed on Sept. 4, 2003, alleges that beginning in 1994 Peter J. Davis, Jr., a Washington, D.C.-based consultant and sole proprietor of Davis Capital Investment Ideas, attended the Treasury Departments quarterly refunding press conferences.  At these press conferences, the Treasury Department announced the Federal Governments financing requirements for the coming quarter.  This information was market-sensitive and thus subject to a press embargo; that is, it could not be disseminated by those attending the conference until a specified time.  The complaint alleges that Youngdahl, who advised Treasury Desk traders on economic and political developments, was Davis primary contact at Goldman Sachs, and that Davis conveyed confidential refunding information to Youngdahl in May 2001.  In July 2001, Davis and Youngdahl agreed in a series of e-mails that Davis would provide Youngdahl with embargoed information from the refunding press conferences.  Pursuant to this agreement, Davis again provided Youngdahl with embargoed information in August 2001.  , The complaint further alleges that, at the Oct. 31, 2001, refunding press conference, Treasury Department officials announced three times that the information being made available was embargoed until 10:00 a.m.  The press conference ended at approximately 9:25 a.m.  Despite the officials warnings, beginning at 9:28 a.m., Davis placed a series of cell phone calls to his clients, including Youngdahl, and told them that the Treasury Department was suspending future long bond issuances.  The complaint alleges that Youngdahl knew that Davis, pursuant to their July agreement, was tipping him with confidential Treasury Department information before the information was released to the public.  The complaint further alleges that, after receiving Davis call on the morning of Oct. 31, 2001, Youngdahl tipped traders on Goldman Sachs U.S. Treasury Desk to the news about the Treasurys decision to cease issuance of the long bond. While the news was still nonpublic, the traders purchased $84 million worth of 30-year bonds for Goldman Sachs own accounts, generating illegal profits of over $1.5 million.  , Youngdahl has consented, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, to the entry of a permanent injunction against future violations of Sections 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and a court order that he pay a fine of $240,000 and be jointly and severally liable for disgorgement of Goldman Sachs trading profits.  , Goldman Sachs has previously settled a Commission administrative proceeding related to this matter and made full disgorgement of its trading profits.  Davis, originally a defendant in the civil action, has also previously settled with the Commission.  , The Commissions investigation into these events is continuing.  Pending the completion of that investigation, the Commission has filed a notice of dismissal as to defendant Stephen E. Nothern. Nothern was the only remaining defendant in this action other than Youngdahl.  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(1), the Commission retains the right to file charges again against Nothern based on or including the original claim.  , The Commission has investigated this matter in coordination with, and acknowledges the cooperation and assistance of, the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York.  The Commission also acknowledges the cooperation and assistance of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the United States Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the United States Postal Inspection Service throughout this investigation., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18453.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Cal.)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today the filing of fraud charges against the former chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and controller of San Diego-based Gateway, Inc., for engaging in a fraudulent earnings manipulation scheme to meet Wall Street analysts expectations, and for making false statements and concealing from the investing public important information about the success of Gateways personal computer (PC) business, in the second and third quarters of 2000.  The Commissions lawsuit, filed today in federal court in San Diego, seeks antifraud injunctions, civil money penalties, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and orders permanently barring the defendants from serving as officers or directors of public companies., Named in the Commissions complaint are the following defendants., <p class=em2>Jeffrey Weitzen, age 47, of Rancho Santa Fe, Calif.  Weitzen was Gateways chief executive officer and a member of its board of directors., <p class=em2>John J. Todd, age 43, of Rancho Santa Fe, Calif.  Todd was senior vice president and chief financial officer of Gateway., <p class=em2>Robert D. Manza, age 42, of Plano, Tex.  Manza was Gateways controller during the relevant time and is a certified public accountant., In a separate administrative proceeding, Gateway, without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, agreed to entry of a Commission order that it cease and desist from violations of the antifraud, reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws., The SECs complaint alleges that defendants misrepresented or failed to disclose (1) significant trends in Gateways business, such as that a material portion of Gateways sales were generated through high-risk loan financing; (2) that PC sales growth was declining; (3) that, by the end of the third quarter, only a small percentage of net income was associated with PC sales; and (4) that revenue and earnings included various one-time transactions.  Through these actions, the defendants gave the false and misleading impression that Gateway, unlike many of its competitors, was outpacing an industry trend of decreasing sales of personal computers., The Commissions complaint alleges that in approximately May 2000, when defendants realized that the company would not meet the expectations of the Wall Street analysts who followed Gateways stock, they embarked on a fraudulent scheme to close the gap between analysts expectations and the companys actual revenue and earnings., According to the complaint, in the second quarter of 2000, the scheme included contacting individuals whose credit applications had previously been denied by the company, and offering them pre-approved financing to facilitate sales.  The sales campaign to high-risk customers contributed more than 5% of Gateways second quarter revenues., Also according to the complaint, when Todd recognized that he could not close the gap simply by increasing the amount of PC sales to high-risk customers, he allegedly authorized a wider variety of improper accounting actions, all of which failed to comply with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  These included (1) reducing loan loss reserves; (2) recognizing revenue from a consignment sale; (3) recognizing revenue from a purported bill-and-hold sale; (4) accelerating purported revenue from payments by America Online, Inc. (AOL) for bundling its internet service with a Gateway PC purchase; (5) recording revenue from the sale of the companys fixed assets; and (6) making additional undisclosed accounting adjustments to meet analysts earnings estimates., According to the Commissions allegations, as a result of the improper accounting actions, Gateway announced that, for the third quarter of 2000, it exceeded analysts expectations for revenue by $30 million, met analysts expectations for earnings per share (EPS) of $0.46, and experienced year-over-year revenue growth of 16%.  According to the complaint, these statements about Gateways financial performance were false and misleading.  The improper actions by defendants caused Gateways net income for the third quarter of 2000 to be overstated by more than ten cents EPS, or 30%, and inflated reported revenue by $154 million, or 6.5%., The complaint alleges that Todd was the principal architect of the fraudulent scheme; that Manza assisted in the fraudulent scheme by, among other things, initiating certain of the one-time transactions and then preparing financial statements knowing that these transactions failed to comply with GAAP; and that Weitzen knew that Gateways third quarter 2000 reported revenues were inflated due to certain extraordinary one-time transactions and high-risk loans and misled the public as to the true state of Gateways business., In its complaint, the Commission charged Weitzen, Todd, and Manza with violating the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Todd was additionally charged with violating the antifraud provision of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 17(a).  For providing a false and misleading management representation letter to Gateways outside auditor to support the third quarter 2000 financial results, the three defendants were also charged with violating the false statements to accountants provision, Rule 13b2-2 under the Exchange Act.  The Commission further charged Todd and Manza with violating record-keeping provisions, Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and the internal controls provision, Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and aiding and abetting Gateways violations of reporting provisions, Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder, and record-keeping provisions, Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act.  Finally, the Commission charged Weitzen with violating the antifraud and reporting provisions as a control person of Gateway., The Commission also instituted a settled administrative proceeding against Gateway.  In its cease-and-desist order, the Commission found that, through the conduct described above, Gateway violated the antifraud, reporting, and record-keeping provisions of the federal securities laws.  The Commission also found that Gateway violated the internal controls provision by failing to observe consistent quarter-end cutoff dates and times, which caused it to have accounting periods of different lengths from quarter to quarter.  Without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, Gateway consented to the Commissions order to cease and desist from committing or causing any violation or future violation of these provisions., In its order, the Commission also found that the Companys cooperation was not exemplary during the early stages of the staffs investigation.  In determining to accept Gateways settlement offer, however, the Commission considered Gateways undertakings to provide further cooperation and recent remedial measures undertaken by Gateways current management and board of directors., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18454.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a> (<a href=/about/acrobat.htm>PDF format</a>),  ]"

Wilcher, a resident of Scottsdale, Arizona, charging her with intentionally defrauding investors out of more than $3 million dollars in connection with a high yield investment scheme and charging her with wire fraud for her role in a pump and dump scheme involving the stock of Hitsgalore.com, Inc.  The indictment charges Wilcher with eight counts of wire fraud and six counts of money laundering., Hitsgalore was a publicly-traded Internet company located in Rancho Cucamonga, California, that maintained a website providing an Internet search engine and leasing advertising space to consumers.  On November 28, 2001, the Commission filed an action against Wilcher and Life Foundation Trust along with Hitsgalore and its former president, Stephen J. Bradford.  The complaint charged Hitsgalore and Bradford with fraud in connection with several press releases issued by the company between April 16 and May 10, 1999 that contained false and misleading statements about a purported investment in Hitsgalore by Life Foundation Trust.  The fraudulent press releases caused a dramatic rise in the price of Hitsgalores stock, quoted on the OTCBB, from $6.3125 to a high of $20.125.  The complaint also charged Life Foundation Trust, a Scottsdale, Arizona, for-profit trust, and its trustee Wilcher, with aiding and abetting Hitsgalores fraud and illegally selling Hitsgalore stock.  The Commission settled its claims against Bradford and Hitsgalore., On July 29, 2002, the Honorable Gary L. Taylor, United States District Judge for the Central District of California, granted summary judgment in favor of the Commission against Life Foundation Trust and Wilcher.  Among other relief, the Court held Life Foundation Trust and Wilcher jointly liable for disgorgement of the $1,024,418.50 that Life Foundation Trust made in profits on the illegal sale of Hitsgalore stock; ordered Life Foundation Trust to pay a civil penalty of $1,024,418.50; and ordered Wilcher to pay a civil penalty of $110,000., The Commission applied for a contempt order after Wilcher and Life Foundation Trust failed to pay the ordered disgorgement.  On March 24, 2003, the Court held Life Foundation Trust and Wilcher in civil contempt for their failure to pay disgorgement.  The March 24 Order required that Wilcher be incarcerated and forced to surrender her passport for failure to disgorge the illegal profits, and required Life Foundation Trust to pay an escalating daily fine of $1,000, doubling every day thereafter until Life Foundation Trust pays the ordered disgorgement.  Wilcher and Life Foundation Trust have not complied with the March 24 Order., Wilcher remains incarcerated awaiting trial in the criminal proceeding., For further information, see related Litigation Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18052.htm>18052</a>, <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18024.htm>18024</a>, <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17646.htm>17646</a>, and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17249.htm>17249</a>., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18455.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Commissions complaint, filed in New Hampshire federal district court, alleges that Goto perpetrated two fraudulent investment schemes beginning in 2002, and has misappropriated approximately $5 million from investors.  The Commission also obtained an asset freeze against Gotos wife, Shaleen Cassily, concerning her receipt of some proceeds of Gotos fraud., According to the Commissions complaint, in the first scheme, Goto made fraudulent misrepresentations to obtain investments in a Boston, Massachusetts-based hedge fund.  Among other things, the complaint alleges that Goto falsely stated to investors that he had previously managed a portfolio of client assets totaling between $250 and $300 million, that he would personally invest between $6 and $7 million in the hedge fund, that the hedge fund was profitable, and that he made investment decisions on behalf of the hedge fund.  According to the complaint, at least 10 investors gave money to Goto to invest in the hedge fund, but instead of placing investor funds in the hedge fund, Goto diverted the funds to bank accounts controlled by him for his own personal gain.  The complaint alleges that in the second scheme, Goto again made fraudulent misrepresentations to obtain investments in a purported hot dog stand vending business.  Among other things, the complaint alleges that Goto falsely stated to investors that he had an exclusive contract to manage hot dog vending stands at Home Depot stores throughout the United States and that investors should expect a minimum return of 500% after two or three years.  According to the complaint, at least 5 investors gave money to Goto to invest in this scheme, and again, instead of investing the funds in the business, Goto diverted those funds to bank accounts controlled by him for his own personal gain., The Commission alleged in its complaint that Goto violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission also named as a relief defendant Gotos wife, Shaleen Cassily.  The complaint alleges that Goto transferred at least $1.4 million of investor funds to a brokerage account in the name of Cassily, and that Goto and Cassily transferred their joint ownership interest in a Bedford, New Hampshire house worth millions of dollars to Cassily as sole owner., The Commission asked the court to enter emergency relief against Goto on the grounds that his fraud is ongoing because he continues to hold investors funds, and as recently as November 12, 2003, has been contacting investors in an attempt to obstruct the investigation into his conduct.  The Commission obtained entry of an order temporarily restraining Goto from directly or indirectly continuing to violate the federal securities laws, and an asset freeze against Goto and Cassily.  The court also granted other emergency relief, including repatriation of all assets obtained from investors that may presently be located outside of the United States, an order prohibiting the destruction of relevant documents, and an accounting to identify, among other things, all assets of Goto or Cassily over $1,000 in value and all transfers of assets by Goto or Cassily over $1,000 in value.  The hearing on the Commissions motion for a preliminary injunction is scheduled for December 3, 2003. , The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the New Hampshire Attorney Generals Office in its investigation.

McCarthy.  The Commissions charges against Triumph and McCarthy arose out of an alleged fraudulent scheme involving the former Connecticut State Treasurers investment of state pension fund money with private equity firms, including Triumph, in exchange for the firms agreement to pay lucrative fees to the Treasurers friends and associates.  In a complaint filed against eleven defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut on October 10, 2000, the Commission alleged that Paul J. Silvester, the former Treasurer of the State of Connecticut, agreed to invest $200 million of state pension funds with Triumph in November 1998.  The complaint alleged that in return, Triumph, through its chairman McCarthy and its general counsel Charles B. Spadoni, agreed to provide $1 million consulting contracts to Silvesters friends, Christopher A. Stack and Lisa A. Thiesfield. , The Commissions complaint alleged that Triumph and McCarthy violated their fiduciary duty to the state pension fund by failing to disclose the alleged quid pro quo arrangement.  Triumph and McCarthy, without admitting or denying the allegations contained in the Commissions complaint, consented to the entry of final judgments against them.  Triumph agreed to the entry of a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  McCarthy agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations of the same provisions, a civil penalty of  $110,000, and a permanent bar from serving as an officer or director of any publicly-traded company. , On July 16, 2003, Triumph and Spadoni were found guilty by a jury in a related criminal trial for their roles in this matter.  The jury found Triumph and Spadoni guilty of various charges, including racketeering and racketeering conspiracy concerning acts of bribery and obstruction of justice, theft/bribery concerning programs receiving federal funds, and wire fraud/theft of honest services.  On September 4, 2003, McCarthy pleaded guilty to criminal charges for his role in this matter.  McCarthy pleaded guilty to one charge of corruptly rewarding a public official.  Under McCarthys plea agreement, he may pay a criminal penalty of between $4,000-$40,000 and may be sentenced to between 15-21 months in prison.  , Silvester, Stack (and his entity, KCATS), Thiesfield and two other parties (Landmark Partners, Inc. and its chairman, Stanley F.

The defendants are Lytle E. Foglesong, Thomas Gregory Cook, James H. Malbaff, and a partnership called Malbaff &amp; Cook.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the antifraud and broker-dealer registration provisions of the federal securities laws and order them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains.  Certain portions of the disgorgement obligations were waived, and no civil penalties were imposed against the defendants, based on their financial conditions.  In related proceedings, the Commission issued administrative orders on November 17, 2003 that bar Fogelsong, Malbaff, and Cook from associating with any broker or dealer in the future., In its complaint in federal court, which it filed on December 19, 2001, the Commission alleged that the defendants fraudulently obtained over $1.1 million by promoting several high yield investment programs to over thirty investors, the majority of whom resided in Virginia.  According to the complaint, the defendants functioned primarily as finders and brokers, delivering most of the investment proceeds to the operators of the purported programs.  The complaint further charged that, during the course of soliciting investors, the defendants made numerous material misrepresentations concerning, among other things, the views of the Commission, the Federal Reserve and other agencies on the investment programs, their own due diligence with respect to the legitimacy of the programs, the programs safety, and the use of investors funds.  Finally, the complaint alleged that the defendants each participated in an extensive lulling campaign once they knew that the investors funds had been misappropriated.  (See Securities and Exchange Commission v. Lytle E. Foglesong, Thomas Gregory Cook, James H. Malbaff, and Malbaff &amp; Cook, Civil Action No. 5:01CV00104 (W.D. Va.); Lit. Rel.

In addition, Malbaff, Cook, and Malbaff &amp; Cook were jointly and severally ordered to disgorge $825,000 in ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest; however, due to their financial condition, no civil penalty was imposed against them, and their disgorgement obligation was waived to the extent it exceeds their outstanding and renewed obligation to make payments totaling $377,000 (plus post-judgment interest) under a Settlement Order entered against them by the Virginia State Corporation Commissions Division of Securities and Retail Franchising.  Fogelsong was ordered to disgorge $1,125,000 in ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, but that obligation was waived, and no civil penalty was imposed, based on his financial condition.    , The above-described final judgments and bar orders conclude this litigation.

On March 7, 2003, Miller, age 54, of West Hartford, Connecticut, pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343 for her role in a financial fraud perpetrated at a American Commercial Financial Corporation (ACFC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Boston-based HPSC, Inc., In a related civil enforcement action, the Commission alleged that Miller improperly received more than $4.7 million in connection with a financial fraud perpetrated by Kevin J. Morrison, also of West Hartford, Connecticut.  According to the Complaint, between 1997 and May 2002, Morrison, the former executive vice president of ACFC, improperly diverted more than $4.7 million of corporate assets to Miller, a purported ACFC factoring customer.  Morrison attempted to conceal his embezzlement by regularly providing fictitious financial reports, which were incorporated in the parent companys Forms 10-K and Forms 10-Q filed with the Commission for the periods ended December 31, 1997 through March 31, 2002, causing HPSC to materially overstate its net income and earnings per share by between 4% and 112% during the affected filing periods.

The defendants also failed to account properly for massive product returns and to establish sufficient sales reserves.

Marshall, a former officer of Inso Corporation, Inc. (later known as eBT International, Inc.), a now defunct software company headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, was charged with securities fraud, making false statements in filings with the Commission, wire fraud, conducting an international monetary transaction to promote fraud, and perjury in connection with a Commission investigation.  If convicted, Marshall faces maximum penalties that range from 5 to 20 years in prison to be followed by 3 years of supervised release and fines of up to $1,000,000 on each count., The indictment alleges that at the end of September 1998, Marshall played a pivotal role in arranging for a Malaysian software distributor to provide Inso with a bogus $3 million purchase order in anticipation of an expected upcoming sale of software to U.S. Airways.  This phony deal represented over 15% of Insos reported third quarter revenues and enabled Inso to meet internal and public targets for revenue growth.  The indictment further alleges that in the following months, when the hoped-for genuine sale to U.S. Airways failed to materialize, Marshall was involved in efforts to cover up the phony purchase order and to pay off the Malaysian distributor who had provided the purchase order.  The indictment charges that at the end of December 1998 and the beginning of January 1999, Marshall procured a $160,000 payoff to the Malaysian distributor by providing Insos chief financial officer with a forged letter agreement reflecting that the payment was part of a separate contract.  Lastly, the indictment charges Marshall with perjury for providing false testimony to attorneys from the Commissions Division of Enforcement when he was questioned about the payoff., On June 21, 2002, the Commission filed related civil enforcement actions against Marshall and other senior executives of Inso, including Bruce Hill, then-general counsel, Steven Paxhia, then-chief executive officer, and Richard P. Vatcher, then-vice president.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Paxhia consented to entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the antifraud and certain reporting provisions of the Exchange Act.  He also agreed to pay disgorgement of his losses avoided from the sale of Inso stock during the relevant time period of $101,000, including pre-judgment interest.

At the time of the conduct at issue, Earl was the vice president for operations of Kurzweil Applied Intelligence, Inc., a software company formerly headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts., The Commissions complaint, filed on July 26, 1995, alleged that, between January 1992 and May 1994, Earl and others engaged in a fraudulent revenue recognition scheme during the time leading up to and following the companys initial public offering of stock in 1993.  The scheme resulted in improper revenue recognition from over eighty transactions.  The complaint alleged that Earl knew and assisted in the practice of using side letters, among other methods, to improperly recognize revenue on contingent sales, and implemented a system whereby product was shipped to an off-site warehouse on sales that had not closed by the end of a quarter.  The complaint further alleged that Earl instructed an employee to provide false information to auditors and concealed his knowledge of the scheme when questioned about it by auditors, and that he sought to conceal the scheme from Kurzweils outside auditors by transferring inventory hidden at the off-site warehouse in rented trucks to other, more remote, locations.  As a result of the conduct alleged in the complaint, Kurzweils Commission filings overstated revenue by more than $8 million during 1993 and 1994, and the company reported a profit when in fact it was losing nearly $8 million., The final judgment permanently enjoined Earl from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder (antifraud provisions) and Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 (prohibiting falsification of issuer books and records, evasion of internal accounting controls and making false statements to accountants).

According to the Commission, no registration statement has been filed with the Commission as to any of the joint venture agreements.   , The Commission further alleges that, in connection with the offer and sale of these investment programs, the defendants, at various times, represented to investors that: (1) their principal was not at risk; (2) they would receive a 25% return on their investment within three to six months; (3) they would receive monthly returns ranging from 5.35% to 6.75%; and (4) only 1 in 10,000 deals resulted in a loss.  In addition, according to the Commission, investors were led to believe that IPIC had bought billions of dollars worth of goods and sold them to large, well-known retailers, such as Mikasa, Inc., Michaels Stores, Inc., Costco Wholesale, Inc., Garden Ridge Corp., J.C. Penney Co., and Pier 1 Imports, Inc.   , In fact, however, according to the Commission, the defendants were actually perpetrating a massive <i>ponzi</i> scheme and continuing to solicit money from unsuspecting investors, including evangelical Christian congregations.  For example, the Commission alleges that IPICs bank statements show no evidence of the commercial transactions that the joint venture agreements describe:  neither outgoing payments to vendors nor incoming payments from customers appear in the bank records.  Instead, according to the Commissions complaint, the bank records reflect apparent <i>ponzi</i> payments to investors, as well as overseas transfers of funds and purchases of luxury items (e.g., a yacht, homes and a helicopter). Furthermore, the Commission alleges that none of the retailers who IPIC identified as customers have any record of purchasing goods from IPIC or Greg Setser.  , Finally, according to the Commission, as recently as October 10, 2003, IPIC was offering its investors the opportunity to convert their joint venture agreements into IPIC founders shares, which were supposedly going to be publicly traded on Nasdaq within 90-120 days; but, as of October 23, 2003, IPIC had not filed an application for listing with Nasdaq. , The Commission also named in its complaint, as relief defendants (seeking return of investor funds they unjustly received and company records) the following individuals associated with IPIC:, , , The Commission alleges in its complaint that the defendants violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition to seeking emergency relief as described above, the Commission is also seeking orders of permanent injunction, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties. The Commission is also seeking asset freezes and disgorgement against the relief defendants, because they hold title to, or received proceeds from the sale of, assets allegedly acquired with investor funds.  , On November 18, 2003, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Texas unsealed a securities fraud and money laundering indictment against Gregory, Cynthia, Charnelle and Deborah Setser, and Henschke, and agents for the FBI and IRS arrested all of those individuals., The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Northern District of Texas, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the IRS Criminal Investigation Division, and the Texas State Securities Board., <!--<P><IMG SRC=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=9 ALT= BORDER=0>  <A href=/litigation/complaints/comp18470.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</A></P>--><!-- End text -->,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18470.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Through this offering, Swickle and UCG fraudulently raised approximately $774,000 from 21 investors.  , The Complaint names the following defendants:, The complaint alleges the following.  Swickle formed UCG in January 2001 purportedly to provide individual currency traders with access to the foreign currency market.  Beginning in May 2001 and continuing through December 2002, Swickle solicited investments in UCG through an unregistered offering of securities.  In connection with the offering, Swickle circulated private placement memoranda to prospective investors that made material misrepresentations and omitted material facts about the identity of UCGs officers and directors, Swickles background and Swickles use of corporate funds.  For example, the private placement memoranda identified four individuals as officers and directors of UCG when, in fact, none of the individuals had agreed to serve in that capacity.  The private placement memoranda also described Swickle as a sophisticated businessman with experience in mergers and acquisitions and in building a major marketing organization.  In fact, Swickle had no such experience.   Finally, the private placement memoranda represented that Swickle was receiving no salary or other compensation for his work at UCG.  In fact, Swickle diverted approximately $224,000 of corporate funds to his personal accounts and used additional corporate funds to pay for personal expenses., In addition, Swickle made oral misrepresentations to investors while soliciting investments by telephone.  For example, Swickle told investors that UCG shares would soon trade publicly and that, once public, the companys shares would hit certain price levels.  In fact, UCG had not taken substantial steps to have its stock trade publicly, and there was no reasonable basis to predict that the stock price would rise to the unrealistic levels Swickle predicted. , Swickle made a number of false statements in a tape-recorded conversation with an FBI agent posing as a prospective investor.  Among those statements was the following, [T]heres a lot of games in this, we dont play any of themall money under management is audited every month99% of your money will go into marketing.  Thats the way its really, thats the way its done, its not going into anybodys pocket.  Its being spent to strengthen the company.  , The complaint charges Swickle and UCG with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint seeks permanent injunctions against Swickle and UCG, and seeks disgorgement and a civil penalty from Swickle. , This case is the result of cooperation between the Division of Enforcements broker-dealer examination staff, the FBI, United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York and the CFTC., For further information, contact:, Mark Schonfeld<br/>Associate Regional Director<br/>(646) 428-1650, or, Kay Lackey<br/>Assistant Regional Director<br/>(646) 428-1790, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18471.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Additionally, the complaint alleged that some Donne investors were promised and paid a guaranteed return of 12% per year on their investment.  The source of these returns, unbeknownst to investors, was other investor money received from new sales of Donne stock.

Nov. 19, 2003)., On November 19, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed an emergency injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against Kruger, Miller &amp; Tummillo, Inc. (KMT), a corporation located in Illinois, and its president Adam G. Kruger, age 22 and resident of Roselle, Illinois.  The action seeks to halt a fraud relating to the offer and sale of interests in at least two investment schemes promoted by Kruger and KMT.  On the same day, Judge Samuel Der-Yeghiayan issued a temporary restraining order restraining Kruger and KMT from moving assets, destroying evidence and raising additional funds for investments.  Judge Der-Yeghiayan also ordered a preliminary injunction hearing for November 26 at 9 a.m., The Complaint alleges that, since approximately August 2000, Kruger raised at least $908,750 from twelve known investors by telling those investors that he would pool their money to day-trade various securities or to purchase stock in a privately-held company.  For these services, Kruger told investors that he would not take any compensation.  The Complaint asserts, however, that Kruger and KMT did not use all the investor money for the promoted investments and, in fact, used at least some of the money to pay Krugers personal expenses.  Kruger and KMT concealed their misuse of investor funds and obtained additional investment dollars by providing false reports to investors that greatly overstated the value of their investments.  The Complaint alleges that KMTs and Krugers actions are ongoing in that Kruger has recently represented to investors that he will pay back their original investment amounts from money obtained through new investment and business deals., The Complaint asserts that Kruger and KMT violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Complaint also asserts that KMT violated Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act and that Kruger aided and abetted such violations.  , In a related case, Kruger was arrested on November 19.

Baxter and Pilgrim Baxter &amp; Associates, Ltd.</i> (United States District Court, E.D. Pa., Civil Action No. 03-CV-6341)</h2>]","[<b>FOUNDERS OF PBHG FUNDS AND PILGRIM BAXTER &amp; ASSOCIATES CHARGED WITH FRAUD IN CONNECTION WITH MARKET TIMING OF PBHG FUNDS</b>, The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on November 20, 2003 it filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against Gary L. Pilgrim, of Malvern, PA, Harold J. Baxter, of Berwyn, PA and Pilgrim Baxter &amp; Associates, Ltd. (Pilgrim Baxter), a registered investment adviser headquartered in Wayne, PA, charging them with fraud and breach of fiduciary duty in connection with market timing of the PBHG Funds.  Pilgrim was the President, Chief Investment Office and Director of Pilgrim Baxter &amp; Associates, and the President of the PBHG Funds.  Baxter was the CEO and Chairman of Pilgrim Baxter &amp; Associates, and the Chairman and trustee of the PBHG Funds and the PBHG Insurance Series Fund.  Both Pilgrim and Baxter resigned from each of these positions on November 13, 2003.  , The Commissions action is being brought contemporaneously with an action in New York State Supreme Court by the New York Attorney General, with whom the Commission has coordinated its efforts in this matter., The Commissions complaint alleges that Pilgrim had a substantial interest in a hedge fund, Appalachian Trails, whose trading strategy involved rapid trading of mutual fund shares.  In March 2000, with the approval of both Pilgrim and Baxter, Appalachian began market timing several PBHG funds including the PBHG Growth Fund, whose portfolio was managed by Pilgrim.  Neither Pilgrim nor Baxter disclosed to the Board of Pilgrim Baxter &amp; Associates, the Board of Trustees of the funds, or fund shareholders, that Pilgrim had an extensive financial interest in Appalachian and that Appalachian had been permitted to implement its trading strategy in PBHG funds.  The complaint alleges that over the next 20 months, Appalachian engaged in approximately 120 short-term exchange transactions from PBHG mutual funds into its cash management fund, far in excess of the limit of four such exchanges per year set forth in PBHGs prospectuses.  In 2000 and 2001, Appalachian profited by more than $13 million from its trading, $3.9 million of which was Pilgrims share., In addition, the Commission alleges that Baxter provided non-public PBHG Fund portfolio information to a close friend in the brokerage business, who was president of Wall Street Discount Corporation, a registered broker-dealer.  The friend then passed this information to Wall Street Discount customers who used the portfolio information to market time the PBHG funds and to exercise hedging strategies through other financial and brokerage institutions., According to the Commissions complaint, the impact of excessive short-term trading on a portfolio managers ability to effectively manage the assets of the funds was known within the organization, as was the fact that the four exchange limitation was in the best interests of shareholders.  Nevertheless, Pilgrim Baxter &amp; Associates permitted numerous PBHG Fund investors to engage in short-term trading without enforcement of the four exchange limitation.  Market-timing assets in the PBHG funds peaked at approximately $600 million.  In July 2001, Pilgrim Baxter &amp; Associates and the PBHG Funds involuntarily redeemed the shares of all identified market timers except for Appalachian and Wall Street Discount, who were permitted to continue their trading through the end of 2001., The complaint charges that Pilgrim, Baxter and Pilgrim Baxter &amp; Associates violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act).  The complaint also charges Pilgrim Baxter &amp; Associates with violating Section 204A of the Advisers Act, and Baxter with aiding and abetting those violations.  The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties, and also seeks that Pilgrim and Baxter be permanently enjoined from acting in certain enumerated positions with an investment company pursuant to Section 36(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18474.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  ]"

The Commissions complaint alleges that Hawes, by an egregious abuse of trust and fraudulent dealings, misappropriated at least $1.2 million from investors whose assets he purported to manage.  The Commission also named Hawes business, Alpha &amp; Omega Transportation, Inc. (Alpha &amp; Omega), as a relief defendant.  The Commission has also filed a proposed Order that Hawes and the other defendants have consented to, which will, among other things, preliminarily enjoin them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, freeze the defendants assets, and prohibit any destruction of documents., The Commissions complaint alleges that Hawes stole from people he had known for many years, including his own elderly parents.  As alleged in the complaint, Hawes conducted his fraudulent schemes through two businesses he created: FMS, an insurance business, and FMAS, an investment adviser business.  In one scheme, the complaint alleges, Hawes, through FMS, falsely told certain investors that he had purchased, as they had directed, annuity policies as investment vehicles.  The complaint further alleges that, in fact, for some investors, Hawes never bought the policies but rather took the policy premium for himself.  For other investors, the complaint alleges that Hawes initially purchased the annuities but later liquidated them without the clients knowledge or authorization, keeping the proceeds for himself.  Additionally, in a separate alleged scheme, Hawes, through FMAS, charged exorbitant and unauthorized management fees to investors who believed he was managing their assets.  Hawes then hid his fraud from these investors by sending false account statements to the investors showing inflated balances and omitting the unauthorized fee deductions. , The Commissions complaint seeks the following permanent relief:  (i) permanent injunctions against future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940; (ii) disgorgement and prejudgment interest (including as to relief defendant Alpha &amp; Omega); and (iii) the imposition of civil money penalties., The Commission thanks the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Pennsylvania Securities Commission, Division of Enforcement, Litigation &amp; Compliance for their cooperation and assistance in this matter., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18475.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  ]"

Fla.)(filed December 6, 2002)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that on November 25, 2003 Anthony Blissett, a defendant in a $51.9 million offering fraud that the SEC halted in December 2002, was sentenced to a 60-month period of incarceration, the maximum statutory sentence, followed by three years of supervised release, based upon his guilty plea to charges of conspiracy to commit securities fraud brought by the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Florida (USOA).  In addition to incarceration, the Court also ordered Blissett to pay $27,038,274.48 in restitution to victims of the scheme.  The criminal prosecution was handled as part of the Securities Fraud Initiative, a coordinated effort by the SECs Southeast Regional Office (in Miami), the USAO, and other agencies, to combat securities fraud in South Florida., Blissetts sentence was based upon criminal charges arising from the same misconduct that led to the SECs action.  According to an Information filed by the USAO, from approximately July 1989 to December 2002, Blissett, as president and chief executive officer of A. B. Financing and Investments, Inc. (ABFI), solicited investors to purchase promissory notes issued by ABFI.  According to the information, Blissett and a co-conspirator used sales materials that contained many materially false statements and omissions, some of which are described below, to induce investors to purchase ABFI notes.  , The SEC filed its emergency civil action against Blissett and ABFI on December 6, 2002. On that same day, the Honorable Ursula Ungaro-Benages, U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of Florida, issued various emergency orders including a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze. On the SECs motion, Judge Ungaro-Benages also appointed Michael I. Goldberg, Esq. as Receiver over ABFI. The SECs complaint charges ABFI and Blissett with violating the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and the securities registration provisions of the Securities Act. The SECs complaint also named certain companies that Blissett controlled as relief defendants., Blissett and ABFI have consented to permanent injunctions in the SECs case, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SECs complaint. In addition, and also without admitting or denying the SECs findings, Blissett consented to an administrative order that the SEC issued on June 26, 2003. That order bars Blissett from association with any investment adviser., The SEC appreciates the efforts of the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Florida in this matter., See also <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17885.htm>Litigation Release No. 17885</a> (Dec. 9, 2002), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17748.htm>Litigation Release No. 17948</a> (Jan. 23, 2003), and <a href=/litigation/admin/ia-2139.htm>Investment Advisers Act Release No. 2139</a> (June 26, 2003)., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18480.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

As alleged in the complaint, the defendants raised at least $1.4 million, including $697,000 since June 30, 2003, from investors in Arizona, California, Illinois, Iowa, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Utah.  The complaint also alleged that the defendants represented that MLLC and Zybell would use investor funds to trade securities for Millennium, including publicly traded stocks and options.  The complaint further alleged that the defendants falsely represented to investors that Millennium achieved a 46% return for the twelve months ended June 30, 2003, when, in fact, Millennium had a substantially lower rate of return.  , The judgments prohibit Millennium, MLLC, and Zybell from committing securities fraud in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Cunningham</i> Civil Action No. 03-N-2421  (District of Colorado)</h2>]","[Today, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado against Invesco Funds Group, Inc., and Raymond R. Cunningham.  Invesco Funds Group, Inc. (IFG), headquartered in Denver, is an investment adviser registered with the Commission and manages the Invesco complex of mutual funds.  Cunningham has been the president of IFG since May 2001 and the chief executive officer since January 2003.  He has also been a member of the board of directors of IFG and the Invesco fund complex since May 2001., The Commission alleged that from at least July 2001 until October 2003, the defendants fraudulently accepted investments by market timers in Invesco mutual funds to enhance the management fees earned by IFG.  The complaint alleges that market timing is the practice of frequent short term buying and selling of mutual funds shares, and that IFG entered into specific arrangements with particular investors under which these investors were allowed to market-time Invesco funds. The complaint further alleges that the defendants accepted these investments knowing that doing so would be detrimental to long-term shareholders in the mutual funds.  In addition, the complaint alleges that accepting these investments was fraudulent because it was contrary to disclosures made in the prospectuses for the mutual funds.  These disclosures stated that exchanges between funds by investors would be limited to four yearly and that changes in this policy would only be allowed if it was in the best interests of the funds., The complaint further alleges that the defendants had a fiduciary duty to act at all times in the best interests of the Invesco mutual funds.  Accordingly, the defendants had an affirmative obligation to act in the utmost good faith, and to provide full and fair disclosure of all material facts to investors.  The complaint alleges that, despite this duty, the defendants never disclosed to shareholders in the funds or to the independent directors or trustees of the funds that particular investors were being allowed to market-time the funds or that IFG had a conflict of interest because the market timing arrangements served to increase its management fees., The complaint alleges that, based on the foregoing, IFG violated the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 set forth in Section 17(a), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 set forth in Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 set forth in Sections 206(1) and (2).  The complaint further alleges that Cunningham violated Sections 17(a) and 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 and that he aided and abetted IFGs violations of Sections 206(1) and (2).  The complaint additionally alleges that IFG and Cunningham violated Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 based on the filing of materially false and misleading registration statements with the Commission.  The registration statements were allegedly false and misleading because they contained the fund prospectuses described above.  Last, the complaint seeks relief against IFG and Cunningham under Section 36(a) of the Investment Company Act.  This provision allows the Commission to seek injunctive relief against, among others, any investment adviser to or director of an investment company based on a breach of fiduciary duty involving personal misconduct. , The Commissions action seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of the defendants ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against both defendants., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18482.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18482.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Wash.)</h2>]","[On November 25, 2003, United States District Judge Marsha J. Pechman in Seattle, Washington, sentenced Kevin Leigh Lawrence, 37, of Bainbridge Island, Washington, to 20 years in prison for his role in the Znetix stock fraud.  On July 28, 2003, Lawrence entered guilty pleas to one count of securities fraud, one count of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, wire fraud, mail fraud, unlawful sale of unregistered securities, money laundering, and engaging in monetary transactions with proceeds of unlawful activity.  Judge Pechman also ordered Lawrence to pay $91,644,845.86 in restitution.  The U.S. Attorney believes that this restitution order is the largest in Washington state history., As part of his guilty plea, Lawrence waived any right to appeal, and agreed to cooperate fully with the U.S. Attorney and the receiver appointed as part of the Securities and Exchange Commissions related case in identifying assets.  Additionally, Lawrence agreed to forfeit a number of previously-seized assets.  Originally indicted on July 31, 2002 in a 64-count indictment, Lawrence admitted that over the course of about seven years he intentionally, knowingly, and willfully defrauded thousands of investors out of up to $100 million through his leadership of a massive conspiracy and scheme to defraud involving false representations and failures to disclose truthful and accurate information in connection with the sale of the securities of Znetix, Inc., Health Maintenance Centers, Inc., Cascade Pointe, LLC, and affiliated entities.  He further admitted that he intentionally, knowingly, and willfully used the funds received from investors for his own personal use and benefit and for the use and benefit of his co-conspirators and others, including for the purchase of luxurious homes, cars, boats, merchandise, and travel. Finally, he admitted that he intentionally, knowingly, and willfully made false statements and directed others to make false statements to the State of Washingtons Department of Financial Institutions, Securities Division, and to the Securities and Exchange Commission., Previously, the Commission filed an emergency action on January 23, 2002, against Lawrence, as well as Znetix, Inc., Health Maintenance Centers, Inc., three related companies, their controlling executives, and several family members of Lawrence, alleging that Lawrence and other executives falsely promised investors lucrative profits from the supposedly imminent initial public offering of Znetix.  Additionally, the Commission alleged that Lawrence spent more than $14 million of investor funds on personal expenses, such as luxury cars, real estate, jewelry and boats.  On January 23, the Commission obtained an order freezing the assets of the defendants, and temporarily enjoining Lawrence and other controlling executives from future violations of the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  On February 15, 2002, the federal court preliminarily enjoined the defendants from such future violations and appointed a permanent receiver over the companies.  , Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, the companies, on June 6, 2002, consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud and securities registration provisions.  Subsequently, the Commission entered into settlement agreements with relief defendants Vicki Lawrence, Stacy Gray, and Bonnie Couch, the ex-wife, fiancée and mother of Lawrence, respectively.  Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, defendant Clifford G. Baird, on October 3, 2003, consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the antifraud and securities registration provisions.  Baird also agreed to disgorge his ill-gotten gains from the stock offerings in the amount of $374,077.36 and pay prejudgment interest in the amount of $8,875.48.  The Court retained jurisdiction to determine the penalty, if any, Baird must pay for his violations of the securities registration provisions.

Yohn, Jr. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment against Joseph F. Doody IV (Doody) of Newtown, Pennsylvania, in a Commission action that charged him with insider trading in the securities of BetzDearborn Inc.  This judgment represents the final settlement in the five insider trading cases brought by the Commission to address trading before the merger of BetzDearborn and Hercules in 1998.  The Commission filed suit against a total of eighteen defendants, and obtained final judgments against each of them, collectively ordering approximately $4 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and penalties., The Commission alleged in its complaint in this matter, filed in November 2001, that Diane C. Neiley, a former employee of BetzDearborn Inc., Doody, and his father, Joseph F. Doody, engaged in illegal insider trading in advance of the July 30, 1998 announcement that BetzDearborn Inc. and Hercules Inc. had agreed to merge.  The Commission alleged that Neiley, an executive assistant at BetzDearborn, learned confidential information regarding the merger and tipped her then-boyfriend, Doody, who in turn tipped his father.  The Commission alleged that Doody purchased BetzDearborn common stock and call options that he sold after the merger announcement, realizing $240,953 in illegal profits.  The Commission further alleged that Doody also tipped his father, Joseph F. Doody, who bought BetzDearborn common stock that he sold after the announcement for unlawful profits of $30,813.  In November 2001, Neiley settled with the Commission by consenting to a final judgment that permanently enjoined her from violating Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, and imposed no civil penalty based on her sworn financial statement.  In July 2003, Joseph F. Doody settled with the Commission by consenting to a final judgment that permanently enjoined him from violating Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, and ordered him to disgorge his illegal profits of $30,813, together with $12,340 in prejudgment interest, and pay civil penalties of $30,813., The final judgment entered by the court on November 18 permanently enjoined Doody from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  It also waived payment of his illegal profits of  $240,953 and prejudgment interest, and did not impose a civil penalty, based on Doodys sworn financial statements.  Doody settled the action without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint.  He is currently serving an 18-month prison term in connection with a related criminal proceeding in which he pled guilty to one count of insider trading and one count of obstruction of justice in December 2002.  , Today, the Commission also instituted administrative proceedings to bar Doody from the securities industry.  Doody consented to the entry of the Commissions Order, which bars him from association with any broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, or investment adviser.  In the Matter of Joseph F.

Ross, engaged in an extensive financial fraud between 1997 and 1999 by inflating the companys reported earnings in its filings with the Commission.  The Commissions Complaint also alleges that two of the companys auditors engaged in the fraud by recklessly causing their accounting firm, Arthur Andersen LLP, to issue an unqualified audit report on Stylings 1998 year-end financial statements and by failing to object to false and misleading statements in Stylings 1999 first and second quarter reports., The Commissions Complaint alleges that, beginning in 1997, Styling began to record false revenue from certain sales transactions, including ones that involved nothing more than the transfer of product to an overseas warehouse.  It also alleges that the fraudulent booking of sales increased significantly during 1998, when the manager of Stylings Body Drench division, Phillip D. Teal, began systematically booking projected sales for the entire year in the current quarter--a practice that culminated at year-end in the recording of revenue from the mere shipment of millions of dollars of product between two company-controlled warehouses.  According to the Complaint,  Stylings vice president of operations, Norman B. Cowgill, approved these year-end transactions.  The Commissions Complaint alleges that, at least one month prior to the filing of Stylings 1998 annual report on Form 10-K, Leopold, Ross, Cowgill and James T. Montrose, the companys former chief accounting officer, knew, or were reckless in not knowing, the nature and extent of the fraudulent sales at Body Drench, yet took no steps to correct the companys improperly recorded accounts receivable.  Leopold, Ross and Montrose, have consented to the entry of permanent injunctions on all of the legal violations alleged against them, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions Complaint., The Commission also alleges that Stylings fraudulent accounting practices continued through the first two quarters of 1999, when the company improperly booked millions of dollars of sales.  In June 1999, it charges, Styling attempted to cover up its fraud by writing off $5.1 million of uncollectible accounts receivable and attributing the lost revenue to a strategic business decision., The Commission further alleges that two former Arthur Andersen auditors, Jay S. Ozer and Bradley J. Schmidt, recklessly failed to detect the fraudulent sales at Styling during 1998.  It  alleges that, despite encountering a number of red flags at Styling, Ozer, the engagement partner on the audit, and Schmidt, the audit manager, failed to ensure that the audit was conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and recklessly caused Arthur Andersen to render an unqualified audit report on Stylings 1998 financial statements.  Ozer and Schmidt, the Commission alleges, also knew or were reckless in not knowing that Stylings statements concerning the $5.1 million write-off in its second quarter report were false and misleading., The Complaint alleges that all of the defendants violated or aided and abetted violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and aided and abetted violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder, and that defendants Leopold, Ross, Teal, Montrose, Cowgill and Schmidt violated or aided and abetted violations of the internal control provisions of the Exchange Act, Section 13(b), and various rules thereunder.  It seeks permanent injunctions and civil penalties from each defendant and seeks disgorgement of certain bonuses paid to Leopold and Ross and an order barring each of them from serving as officers and directors of any public company., Three of Stylings officers, Leopold, Ross and Montrose, have consented to the entry of permanent injunctions on all of the legal violations alleged against them, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions Complaint.  In addition, Leopold has agreed to pay $225,000 in disgorgement and pre-judgment interest and $100,000 as a civil penalty.  Ross has agreed to pay $100,000 in disgorgement.  Both Leopold and Ross have consented to the entry of orders barring them from serving as officers and directors of any public company.

The Judgment further states that in any motion or hearing to determine the appropriate amount of disgorgement or civil penalties, Pozner will not contest his liability under the foregoing securities laws., The Commissions Complaint alleged that Pozner, then a trader at a brokerage firm called Glenn Michael Financial Corporation, engaged in a scheme with other defendants from July through November 2000 to manipulate the public trading market for stock issued by Freedom Surf, Inc. (See Litigation Release No. 17756, September 30, 2002).  Freedom Surf was then a start-up company with offices in Huntington Beach, California.  The Complaint alleged that certain defendants transferred Freedom Surf stock at no cost to defendant Allen Wolfson.  Wolfson, Pozner and other defendants then participated in a scheme to artificially run up the price of Freedom Surf stock.  The Complaint alleged that Pozner and others advanced the bid quotation in Freedom Surf stock without relation to genuine market demand or worth of the company.  The Complaint alleged that in less than two months, Pozner, at Wolfsons direction, and without client orders, bid up the stock from $5 to $35.

Blackwelder also posted positive messages about STWA on an Internet stock message board without disclosing, as required, that he received shares of STWA as payment for the promotion.

Mutuals.com, Inc., Connely Dowd Management, Inc., MTT Fundcorp, Inc., Richard Sapio, Eric McDonald, and Michele Leftwich</i>, Civil Action No.303 CV 2912D (N.D.Tex.) </h2>]","[On December 4, 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil securities fraud action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, against Mutuals.com, Inc., its CEO, its president, and its compliance officer, as well as two affiliated broker-dealer firms.  According to the SECs complaint, the defendants fraudulently helped institutional brokerage customers and advisory clients to carry out and conceal thousands of market timing trades and illegal late trades in shares of hundreds of mutual funds.  The SEC initially detected the alleged misconduct during an examination of the Mutuals.com investment complex in October 2003., The SEC asked the court to enjoin the defendants from further securities law violations, and also sought civil money penalties and disgorgement of illicit profits plus prejudgment interest.  The Commission also sought, and the defendants consented to, the appointment of a Special Monitor to oversee the defendants business operations, including the management of the Mutuals.com Trust mutual funds (formerly known as 1-800 MUTUALS Advisor Series), pending resolution of the civil litigation., The SEC named the following individuals and entities as defendants in the action:, In its complaint, the SEC alleges that Mutuals.com, CDM and MTT facilitated thousands of market timing trades and late trades, at the direction of and with the full knowledge and approval of Sapio, McDonald and Leftwich.  According to the complaint, the only advisory services Mutuals.com provided for its clients was advice on how to employ deceptive trading techniques to engage in improper mutual fund trades, as well as assistance in the implementation of those techniques and concealment of the illicit trading., With respect to the defendants market timing scheme, the SEC alleges that, between July 2001 and September 2003, hundreds of mutual fund companies and two clearing firms admonished Mutuals.com that its clients and customers market timing activity was improper, and, by September 2003, approximately 294 different mutual fund companies had banned or otherwise restricted Mutuals.com from trading in their shares.  In response, according to the Commissions complaint, Sapio, McDonald and Leftwich devised and perpetrated a number of deceptive acts and practices to conceal their clients market timing activities.  Specifically, the Commission alleges that, whenever a fund tried to restrict timing activities, Mutuals.com and its principals used means such as: (1) formation and registration of two affiliated broker-dealers (CDM and MTT) through which they could continue to market time undetected; (2) changing account numbers for blocked customer accounts; (3) use of alternative registered representative numbers for registered representatives who were blocked from trading by mutual funds; (4) use of different branch identification numbers; (5) switching clearing firms; and (6) suggesting that their customers use third party tax identification numbers or social security numbers to disguise their identities, so that they could continue to trade in funds from which they had been banned., Market timing refers to the practice of short term buying and selling of mutual fund shares in order to exploit inefficiencies in mutual fund pricing.  Although market timing is not illegal, it may harm long-term mutual fund shareholders, and many mutual funds try to prevent market timing., With respect to late trading, the SECs complaint alleges that, at least during 2003, Mutuals.com and its affiliated broker dealers routinely received trading instructions from customers after 4:00 p.m. EST and executed those trades as if the trading instructions had been received prior to that time.  According to the SEC, Mutuals.com and its affiliates attempted to conceal late trading activities by omitting portions of the trading information they were required to provide to clearing agents., Late trading refers to the practice of placing orders to buy or sell mutual fund shares after market close at 4:00 p.m. EST, but at the net asset value (NAV), or price, determined at the market close at 4:00 p.m. EST.  Late trading enables the trader to profit from market events that occur after 4:00 p.m. EST but that are not reflected in that days price.  Late trading is illegal., The SEC alleges that, by way of the conduct alleged in the complaint:  (i) each of the proposed defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act);  (ii) each of the proposed defendants violated, and aided and abetted their customers and clients violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (iii) Mutuals.com, CDM and MTT violated Section 15(c)(1) of the Exchange Act; (iv) Sapio, McDonald and Leftwich aided and abetted those violations of Section 15(c)(1) of the Exchange Act; and (v) Mutuals.com, CDM and MTT violated Rule 22c-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (which prohibits the purchase or sale of mutual fund shares except at a price based on the current NAV of such shares that is next calculated after receipt of a buy or sell order)., <b>Additional Materials:</b><br/><img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18489.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a><br/><img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18489so.htm>Stipulation Order</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18489.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Dawson, United States District Judge for the District of Nevada, issued a temporary restraining order halting an ongoing $48 million Ponzi-like investment scheme by Connie S. Farris, age 59, of Henderson, Nevada; Dawn M. Reese, age 45, of Las Vegas, Nevada; and three entities owned or controlled by Farris: Global Express Capital Real Estate Investment Fund I, LLC (the Fund), Global Express Capital Mortgage Corp. (GECM), and Global Express Securities, Inc. (GE Securities), a Las Vegas-based broker-dealer.  The Court: (1) granted the Commissions application for a temporary restraining order; (2) appointed a temporary receiver; (3) placed a freeze on certain defendants assets; (4) prohibited the destruction of documents by the defendants; (5) ordered accountings from the defendants; and (6) granted expedited discovery., The Fund is headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada.  GECM, which is headquartered in Billings, Montana, is the sole manager of the Fund and is responsible for all of the Funds activities.  GE Securities, which is headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada, is registered with the Commission as a broker-dealer.  It offers and sells investments in the Fund; it does not offer or sell any other securities.  Farris, through a holding company, is the sole shareholder of GECM and GE Securities.  She also is the sole officer and director of GECM.  Reese is the president of GE Securities., The Commissions complaint, filed today, alleges that, since late 2001, the defendants have offered and sold interests in the Fund, which purports to pool investor funds to purchase interests in mortgage loans and trust deeds and to pay regular monthly returns to investors from the interest earned from the Funds investments.  To date, the Fund has raised at least $48 million from about 600 investors nationwide.  The defendants have promised, and have actually paid to investors, a return on their investments equal to at least 12% annually.  The complaint alleges that, contrary to the defendants representations, the Fund is not generating sufficient interest income to pay the monthly distributions it is making to investors and, in fact, is operating as a Ponzi-like investment scheme.  The defendants are funding the monthly investor distributions with cash from new investors as well as with capital contributions from Farris and GECM and proceeds from the sale of non-cash assets of the Fund.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the Fund, aided and abetted by Farris, filed with the Commission materially false and misleading quarterly reports that misrepresent the financial condition of the Fund., The Commission obtained an order temporarily restraining the defendants from committing securities fraud in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The order also temporarily restrains GE Securities from committing securities fraud in violation of Section 15(c) of the Exchange Act.  The order further temporarily restrains the Fund from violating, and Farris from aiding and abetting violations of, the reporting requirements of Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 15d-13 thereunder, and temporarily restrains Farris from violating the certification requirements of Rule 15d-14 under the Exchange Act.  The Court also ordered a freeze on the assets of the Fund, GECM and GE Securities and appointed a temporary receiver over each of the entities., The Court ordered the temporary restraining order and asset freeze to remain in effect until December 17, 2003 at 10 a.m., at which time the Court will hold a hearing on the Commissions motion for a preliminary injunction and appointment of a permanent receiver.  In addition to the interim relief granted today, the Commission seeks a final judgment against the defendants enjoining them from future violations of the foregoing antifraud, reporting and certification provisions, ordering them to disgorge all ill-gotten gains, and assessing civil penalties against them.  The Commission also seeks an order prohibiting Farris from acting as an officer or director of any public company., The Commission would like to acknowledge the substantial assistance of the Nevada Secretary of State, Securities Division, in the investigation of this matter., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18491.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

(Greater Northwest).  Langrill and Beckers alleged conduct was, in part, the subject of a successful enforcement action brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) in 2002.  The information and complaint, filed by the United States Attorney for the District of Nevada, alleges that Langrill and Becker disseminated false information about Greater Northwest to the public, including false information about its legal status, the identity of its directors, its eligibility for quotation on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board and its future financial performance, in order to sell their Greater Northwest stock at artificially high prices.  The information and complaint also alleges that Becker and Langrill failed to disclose that Greater Northwest was controlled by Langrill, a convicted felon.  The false information was disseminated between January 30 and late February 2002.  Langrill and Becker then sold their shares of stock into the resulting artificially inflated market, thereby realizing profits of $24,537 and $46,400, respectively., As a result of its lawsuit, in April 2003 the Commission succeeded in obtaining  Default Judgments against Langrill and Becker enjoining them from directly or indirectly violating Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(d), 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, 13d-1, 13d-2, 16a-2 and 16a-3 thereunder.  The Default Judgments also permanently enjoined Langrill and Becker from participating in offerings of penny stock and acting as officers or directors of public companies.  Langrill and Becker each were ordered to pay disgorgement plus prejudgment interest.   Langrill  was also ordered to pay a $25,000 civil penalty, and Becker was ordered to pay a $45,000 civil penalty., The Commissions civil action alleged that Langrill and Becker made the false statements about Greater Northwest described above.  The action also alleged that Langrill and Becker sold restricted Greater Northwest stock in unregistered transactions, while the false statements were disseminated through press releases, an Internet website, and a cable television infomercial.  According to the  Commissions complaint, Langrill and Becker failed to file mandatory periodic and current reports with the Commission on behalf of Greater Northwest since 1996, and further failed to report their beneficial ownership and disposition of Greater Northwest stock., The Commission wishes to thank the United States Attorneys Office for the District of Nevada and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for their cooperation and assistance in this matter., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18492.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

McMullin previously paid $1.55 million in restitution to the bankruptcy trustee., From approximately 1986 until May 2001, Slatkin operated a massive Ponzi scheme in which he solicited more than $593 million from approximately 800 investors.  In his plea agreement, McMullin admitted that when the SEC began a formal investigation of Slatkins activities in 1999, McMullin and Slatkin conspired to obstruct the SECs investigation.  McMullin and Slatkin, among other things, lied to the SEC by minimizing McMullins role in, and knowledge of, Slatkins bogus investment activities.

The criminal case was prosecuted by the U.S. Attorneys office for the District of South Carolina., On February 14, 2002, the SEC charged Goldstein, Noe, Carolyn Kaplan, Nuell Paschal, Noel Alelov, Great American Trust Company and Great American Trust Corporation with fraudulently raising not less than $1.1 million in a prime bank scheme.  According to the Commissions complaint filed in the federal district court for the District of South Carolina, the Commission alleges that the defendants targeted both cash-poor companies unable to obtain funding through conventional means, and individual investors who desired to earn high investment returns quickly.  Goldstein and Noe and their Great American Trust companies served as the primary offerors of the investment programs that comprised the fraudulent scheme, while the other defendants served as finders or selling agents, locating and luring potential investors to Goldstein and Noe and receiving finders fees.  The programs, which were promoted via the Internet and an intricate network of so-called consultants or finders, featured the use of purported prime bank instruments, wholly fictional securities allegedly traded on an equally fictitious secondary market., Additional information can be found in Litigation Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17362.htm>17362</a> and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18349.htm>18349</a>., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18498.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Slatkin and with taking steps to conceal Slatkins plot to hide his Ponzi scheme from the SEC.  From approximately 1986 until May 2001, Slatkin operated a massive Ponzi scheme in which he solicited more than $593 million from approximately 800 investors., On May 11, 2001, the SEC obtained a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against Slatkin in federal district court in Los Angeles.  The SEC alleged that Slatkin defrauded hundreds of clients through his unregistered investment advisory business located in Santa Barbara, California., Janu, 56, formerly of Santa Fe, New Mexico, has agreed to plead guilty when she is arraigned in January to obstructing the SECs investigation and to misprision of a felony for concealing Slatkins scheme in an attempt to deceive the SEC regarding the authenticity of Slatkins account statements., In her plea agreement, Janu admitted that, at Slatkins direction, she created and revised account statements and other documents that supported Slatkins claim that he held over $500 million in securities in brokerage accounts at the fictitious entity NAA Financial of Zurich, Switzerland.  Janu knew these documents were to be submitted to the SEC.  Janu created these bogus statements on her computer and printed the NAA account statements on blank, European-sized stationary provided to her by Slatkin that contained NAAs name and purported Swiss address.  Slatkin then instructed Janu to erase the account statements from her computer., During the SEC investigation, Janu falsely testified under oath that she did not have any knowledge of any direct or indirect power held by Slatkin over any accounts in any kind of foreign financial institutions.  In addition, Janu falsely testified that she had never heard the name NAA Financial., On June 7, 2001, in the SECs action, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a Judgment of Permanent Injunction against Reed E. Slatkin.  Slatkin, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, consented to the entry of the injunction from future violations of the federal securities laws.  Slatkin has also been barred by the Commission from associating with any investment adviser., On September 3, 2003, Judge Morrow sentenced Slatkin to 14 years in prison for his role in the massive Ponzi scheme.

The Commission alleged that the Gulkins learned of the merger negotiations and bought the stock before the public announcement in June 2001.  After the announcement, the Gulkins sold their stock and gained a total of $16,357 in illicit profits. , The Commission also announced that it has reached a settlement with the Gulkins.  The Gulkins have consented, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions Complaint, to the entry of a final judgment that (1) permanently enjoins them from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, (2) orders them to disgorge $16,357 in profits and to pay prejudgment interest in the sum of $1,963.19, and (3) orders the Gulkins to pay civil penalties amounting to $16,357.   The Commission has submitted the proposed final consent judgment to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York., The Commissions Complaint alleges as follows:, On or about June 8, 2001, an individual with whom the Gulkins shared a relationship of trust and confidence learned material nonpublic information that Hotjobs.com was involved in confidential negotiations to be acquired by TMP Worldwide.  During one or more conversations with that individual between June 8 and June 29, 2001, when TMP Worldwides acquisition of Hotjobs.com was publicly announced, the Gulkins learned about the takeover plans.  Lianne and Stanley Gulkin bought shares of Hotjobs.com on June 18, 2001, and Stanley Gulkin made two more purchases on June 26 and June 29, 2001, prior to the public announcement.

Ohio) (December 11, 2003)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, alleging that Brian J. Stucke, formerly Director of Compliance and Associate Vice President at National Century Financial Enterprises, Inc. (NCFE), participated in a scheme to defraud investors in securities issued by subsidiaries of NCFE.  NCFE, a private corporation located in Dublin, Ohio, and its subsidiaries collapsed suddenly in October 2002 when investors discovered that the companies had hidden massive cash and collateral shortfalls from investors and auditors.  The collapse caused investor losses exceeding $1 billion.  , Stucke, a resident of London, Ohio, consented to a permanent injunction prohibiting him from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws; an order barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company; and orders of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty, with those amounts to be determined at a later hearing., The complaint alleges that two wholly owned subsidiaries of NCFE purchased medical accounts receivable from health-care providers and issued notes that securitized those receivables.  From at least February 1999 to October 2002, the subsidiaries offered and sold at least $3.25 billion in total notes through private placements to institutional investors., The complaint further alleges that senior NCFE officials improperly advanced to health-care providers $1 billion or more of the capital raised from investors without receiving required medical accounts receivable in return.  These advances were essentially unauthorized, unsecured loans to distressed or defunct health-care providers-many of which were partly or wholly owned by NCFE or its principals.  The unsecured advances were inconsistent with representations made by senior NCFE officials in offering documents provided to investors., According to the complaint, Stucke aided other NCFE officials in concealing their fraud from trustees, investors, potential investors, and auditors by preparing the forms used to authorize improper advances made by other NCFE officials; transferring funds between the subsidiaries bank accounts to mask cash shortfalls of as much as $400 million; improperly using $101 million in proceeds from a new offering to cover existing reserve-account shortfalls; and creating and distributing false monthly investor reports to trustees, investors, potential investors, and auditors., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Stucke consented to the entry of an order that: (1) permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder; (2) permanently bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company; and (3) orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil monetary penalty, with those amounts to be determined at a later hearing., The Commission filed its action at the same time that the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Ohio unsealed a criminal information against Stucke for the conduct that is the subject of the Commissions complaint.

The judgment against Grossman permanently enjoins him from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Grossman was also ordered to pay disgorgement of $435,687, prejudgment interest of $105,208, and a civil penalty of $435,687., In a related criminal proceeding, Grossman previously pled guilty to insider trading, and was sentenced to twenty-one months incarceration and a $300,000 fine.  Grossman is currently serving his sentence., The Commissions Complaint alleges that John Freeman, a temporary word-processing employee at Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., Inc. and later Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation, tipped a number of defendants (including Grossman) about merger and acquisition transactions involving clients of those investment banking firms.  Specifically, John Freeman tipped Grossman in advance of eight deals.  Grossman then realized profits of $435,687 by trading on this inside information.  In exchange for the inside information, Grossman gave Freeman expensive bottles of wine from Grossmans wine collection, as well as cash.    , The Commissions civil action has now been concluded against eighteen of the nineteen original defendants.

Johnson, Nicor Energys former Director of Financial Services, John Fringer, Nicor Energys former Vice President of Power Services and Regulatory Affairs, and John F. Weir, Nicor Energys former Director of Gas Services and Major Markets, engaged in a scheme that improperly inflated Nicor Energys net income by over $11 million.  Stoffer, Fringer and Johnson were indicted in connection with the same conduct., In its case, the SEC alleged that the defendants, using Nicor as a conduit, made material misstatements, and omitted to state material facts, to the investing public regarding Nicor Energys financial condition and results of operations for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2001.  The complaint alleges that the defendants knowingly or recklessly overstated Nicor Energys unbilled revenue accounts, understated Nicor Energys accounts receivable (bad debt) reserve, shifted 2001 expenses into 2002 and shifted 2002 income into 2001, in order to inflate Nicor Energys 2001 income by more than $11 million.  As a result of the fraud, Nicor Energy erroneously reported to Nicor and Dynegy net income of $4.097 million instead of losses of $7.47 million for 2001.  , The complaint charged the defendants with violating the antifraud and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws (Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder).

Specifically, the Commissions Complaint alleged that throughout 1999, Cumulus and its former Chief Financial Officer, Richard J. Bonick, Jr., prematurely recorded revenue from advertising contract packages into Cumulus books, records and accounts.  The Commission alleged that this practice caused Cumulus to overstate its net revenues and broadcast cash flows and understate its net losses for the first and third quarters of 1999.  These misstated financial figures were incorporated into Cumulus Forms 10-Q for the first and third quarters of 1999 and into Form S-3 registration statements and prospectuses for secondary offerings of Cumulus common stock during July and November 1999.  The Commissions Complaint further alleged that in a second scheme, Cumulus, its former Executive Chairman, Richard W. Weening, and its former Vice President of Finance, Daniel ODonnell, engaged in an attempt to manage Cumulus earnings and broadcast cash flow for the fourth quarter of 1999 in order to bring those figures in line with Wall Street analysts expectations for that quarter.  Specifically, the Commission alleged that after learning that Cumulus did not meet Wall Street analysts expectations for the fourth quarter of 1999, Weening instructed ODonnell to amend agreements with two related companies adding provisions to the agreements that would condition the amount of money paid by Cumulus to the related companies on Cumulus performance as compared to analyst expectations.  At the time he instructed ODonnell to amend the agreements, Weening knew that Cumulus performance for the fourth quarter of 1999 was below analyst expectations.  At that time, Weening also knew that the amendments would require the related companies to refund money paid to them by Cumulus in order for Cumulus to meet analysts expectations for the fourth quarter of 1999.  When Cumulus auditors eventually learned of this practice, they told Weening that the manner in which he was attempting to record the effect of the amendments was indicative of earnings management.  Based on these comments, Cumulus canceled the amended agreements and reversed related accounting entries prior to their inclusion in Cumulus financial statements., All of the defendants, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint, consented to the entry of final judgments against them upon filing of the Complaint.  Bonick consented to the imposition of an order permanently enjoining him from violating or aiding and abetting violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13a-13 and 13b2-1 thereunder for his role in overstating Cumulus net revenues and broadcast cash flows and understating Cumulus net losses.  Bonick also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $50,000.  In addition, Weening and ODonnell consented to the imposition of orders permanently enjoining them from violating or aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder for their roles in the attempt to manage Cumulus earnings and broadcast cash flows.

HEARTLAND ADVISORS et al., </i> (United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin) 03 C-1427</h2>]","[The SEC announced that it filed a civil injunctive action in the Eastern District of Wisconsin against Heartland Advisors Inc. (Heartland Advisors), William Nasgovitz, Paul Beste, Jilaine Bauer, Thomas Conlin, Greg Winston, Kevin Clerk, Kenneth Della, Hugh Denison and Raymond Krueger.  In its complaint, the SEC alleges that Heartland Advisors, through Nasgovitz, Beste, Bauer, Clark, Conlin and Winston misrepresented the NAVs of two high yield municipal bond funds, the Heartland Short Duration High-Yield Municipal Bond Fund and the Heartland High-Yield Municipal Bond Fund (the Funds) and, in Commission filings and promotional materials, their efforts to manage certain risks associated with investing in the Funds.  For example, Heartland Advisors represented that it was actively managing the Funds to minimize share price fluctuation when it was not doing so.  Heartland Advisors also represented that it performed intensive credit research and limited the percentage of unrated high yield bonds held by funds.  In reality, Heartland Advisors conducted inadequate research and the vast majority of bonds held by the Funds were unrated and relatively illiquid.  Finally, Heartland Advisors misrepresented that it and the Funds Board of Directors would monitor and maintain sufficient liquidity in the Funds portfolio holdings to assure that the Funds would be able to meet redemptions.  They did not do so.  Instead the Funds had to borrow millions to meet redemptions.  As a result, by mid-2000, the Funds were suffering a cash flow crisis., The SEC also alleges that the root of this problem was that Heartland Advisors, through Nasgovitz, Conlin, Winston, Beste, Bauer, Clark and Della, in order to protect the Funds performance, refused or failed to adjust the prices of the Funds securities despite numerous indications that the bonds held by the Funds could only be sold at substantial discounts to their carrying values.  Heartland Advisors later arranged a purported sale of those bonds that, in reality, more closely resembled a short-term loan to temporarily infuse cash into the Funds.  Nevertheless, the substantially discounted sale prices of those bonds caused the Funds NAVs to drop materially on Sept. 28, 2000 (the September Devaluation). Thereafter, Heartland Advisors misrepresented to investors the cause of the September Devaluation.  Faced with continuing redemptions and consequent cash flow problems, which caused it to consider suspending redemptions, on October 13, Heartland Advisors repriced most of the bonds in the Funds portfolios by taking an across-the-board discount.  This resulted in another substantial drop in the Funds NAVs (the October Devaluation).  Again, Heartland Advisors misrepresented the real reason for this drop in the Funds NAVs. The complaint alleges that Denison, an associated Director of the Funds failed to adequately monitor the liquidity of the Funds and to take adequate steps to address the Funds pricing deficiencies.  , Finally, the SEC alleges that while investors were kept unaware of the Funds problems, Nasgovitz tipped Krueger about the Funds continuing liquidity and/or pricing problems prior to the September Devaluation, and Krueger liquidated his shares in one of the Funds.  In addition, with knowledge of the Funds continuing liquidity and pricing problems: Winston, a portfolio manager of the Funds, liquidated his shares in the Funds and tipped his family to liquidate their shares in one or more of the Funds, or a related fund; Bauer liquidated her shares in one of the Funds; and Della liquidated his shares in the Funds and redeemed his fathers shares in a related fund., The SEC charged: Heartland Advisors with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act), Sections 34(b) and 36(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (Investment Company Act) and Rule 22c-1(a) promulgated thereunder; Nasgovitz, Conlin, Winston, Beste, Bauer, and Clark with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 34(b) and 36(a) of the Investment Company Act, and aiding and abetting violations of Section 206 of the Advisers Act; Della with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 36(a) of the Investment Company Act and aiding and abetting violations of Section 206 of the Advisers Act; Krueger with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and Denison with violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act and Section 36(a) of the Investment Company Act.

In the press release, Pinnacle stated that after the spin-off to Pinnacle shareholders, All Pro would seek a listing on the American Stock Exchange, and that its initial trading price would be $4.00 per share.  The Commissions complaint alleged that Pinnacle lacked a reasonable basis for stating that All Pro would trade at $4.00 per share, that Pinnacle misquoted an AMEX floor broker to convey a false and misleading endorsement of the companys claims, and that Pinnacle overstated the likelihood that All Pro would obtain an AMEX listing.  After the Commission filed its complaint, the All Pro spin-off did not take place., In August 2003, Pinnacle announced that Turino and Lo Castro had resigned from their positions with the company and that the company has no assets, no operating business and no sources of revenue.

Chamberlin, alleging that they raised approximately $7.6 million in the fraudulent offer and sale of fictitious prime bank securities, in two separate programs., The Commissions Complaint alleges that, from approximately July through August 2000, Donald Chamberlin and his now defunct investment advisory firm solicited clients and others to invest in two separate prime bank schemes.  The Complaint also alleges that Donald Chamberlin made material misstatements and omitted to state material facts to investors regarding the existence and risk of prime bank securities, the rate of return on the two prime bank programs, and the use of investment proceeds.  Although variations existed regarding what investors were told, the essence of the promises made to investors was the same:  all were promised that their money was being invested in a guaranteed, risk-free, high-yield prime bank debenture trading program.  Instead of investing funds, Donald Chamberlin used approximately $1.3 million to pay personal expenses, including, among other things, mortgage payments and country club fees.  In addition, Donald Chamberlin used approximately $2.6 million in new investor funds to repay prior investors, effectively operating a Ponzi scheme.  The Complaint further alleges that David Chamberlin aided and abetted the violative conduct by, among other things, setting up and acting as a signatory on domestic and offshore bank accounts and lulling investors through unfounded assurances that the programs were performing well., Specifically, the Commission alleges that:  (1) Donald Chamberlin violated Section 17(a)(1), (2) &amp; (3) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and aided and abetted his defunct advisory firms violations of Sections 206(1) &amp; (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940; and (2) David Chamberlin aided and abetted violations of Sections 10(b) and 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and violations of Sections 206(1) &amp; (2) of the Advisers Act., The Commission is seeking the entry of a permanent injunction, disgorgements of any ill-gotten gains, plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty from each of the defendants., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18507.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Cal.)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission and the United States Attorneys Office for the Central District of California announced today the filing of civil and criminal charges, respectively, against Richard Marks, the former President and Chief Operating Officer of Motorcar Parts and Accessories, Inc.  Motorcar, a public company based in Torrance, California, remanufactures automotive alternators and starters.  Motorcars stock previously traded on Nasdaq and now trades on the over-the-counter market., The SECs civil complaint and the Justice Departments criminal action, filed today in federal district court in Los Angeles, allege that Marks engaged in fraudulent accounting practices and falsified Motorcars books and records, thereby causing Motorcar to issue false and misleading financial information to the investing public in its 1997 and 1998 Forms 10-K filed with the SEC.  Marks, 51, of Los Angeles, has agreed to plead guilty to the criminal charges and, in settlement of the SECs action, to pay over $1.2 million and to be permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company., The criminal charges against Marks focus on his false inflation of Motorcars revenues and profitability for fiscal year 1997 by falsely reporting as revenues sales that in fact were shipped after year-end, a practice sometimes known as leaving a period open.  The charges against Marks also stem from a double-counting of inventory in connection with the audit at fiscal year-end 1998.  While Motorcars public accountants were not on the premises, Marks caused Motorcar personnel to move truckloads of goods that had already been counted and included in inventory at one warehouse to another warehouse so that they would be included a second time in the auditors test counts the following day.  By causing the transferred inventory to be double-counted, unbeknownst to the auditors, Marks fraudulently caused the amount of Motorcars inventory to be materially overstated in Motorcars financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1998., The SECs civil complaint alleges that Marks directed two fraudulent schemes at the end of fiscal years 1997 and 1998 relating to returned alternators and starters and customer credits.  First, Marks hid product returns from Motorcars independent auditor by shipping the returns to offsite storage.  After completion of the audit, Marks allowed the returns to be checked into inventory.  Second, Marks caused Motorcar to understate its reserve for returns and to delay issuing credits to customers by directing his staff to prepare false schedules for the auditor that supported an understated reserve for credits that the company had not yet processed.  The SECs complaint further alleges that Marks lied to Motorcars independent auditors when he caused transferred inventory to be double counted., The SECs complaint alleges that his actions resulted in the company overstating its pre-tax earnings for fiscal year 1997 by $3,391,000, or 59.8%, and for fiscal year 1998 by $3,576,000, or 49.6%; that the overstated earnings figures were reported to the public in Motorcars annual reports on Form 10-K; and that Motorcar included its false 1997 financial statements in a registration statement filed with the SEC in October 1997 for an offering that raised $19.8 million., The SEC charged Marks with violations or aiding and abetting violations of the antifraud, corporate reporting, books and records, internal controls, and lying to the auditor provisions of the federal securities laws.  Specifically, Marks was charged with violating or aiding and abetting violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2.  Marks simultaneously settled the SECs action without admitting or denying the complaints allegations.  As part of his settlement, Marks agreed (1) to be permanently enjoined from committing future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, (2) to pay disgorgement of $651,500, consisting of 1997 and 1998 bonuses of $254,000 and $397,500 in ill-gotten gains from his sale of Motorcar stock, as well as prejudgment interest of $239,188, (3) to pay a $330,000 civil penalty, and (4) to be permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company., In the related criminal case, Marks agreed to plead guilty to a two-count information charging him with making false statements in two Form 10-K reports that were filed with the SEC.  In a plea agreement filed this morning, Marks admitted that he directed Motorcar employees to engage in fraudulent accounting practices and to falsify Motorcars books and records, thereby causing false and misleading statements to be made to the investing public about Motorcars income.  The two charges against Marks each carry a maximum possible penalty of 10 years in federal prison and a $1 million fine., On September 18, 2002, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Central District of California filed criminal charges against Peter Bromberg, Motorcars former CFO, relating to his role in directing Motorcar employees to engage in fraudulent accounting practices and in causing false and misleading statements to be made to the investing public about Motorcars revenues and income.  Bromberg has pled guilty to these criminal charges and is awaiting sentencing., Also on September 18, 2002, the SEC filed a civil suit against Motorcar and Bromberg arising out of the SECs investigation into Motorcars financial statements and reporting practices for fiscal years 1997 and 1998.  Both Motorcar and Bromberg have settled the SECs action., The civil case was investigated by the SEC.

Judge Feikens also ordered Keith Pietila to pay $128 million in restitution.  Previously, in May 2002, Lasky pled guilty to one count of wire fraud., Lasky and Patrick Quinlan, Lee Wells, Pietila, Alexander Ajemian, John OLeary and Cheryl Swain are the defendants in a pending civil injunctive action filed by the Commission on April 23, 2002 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan arising out of MCAs alleged violations of the antifraud, reporting and other provisions of the federal securities laws.  The Complaint alleges that MCA was a mortgage banking company headquartered in Southfield and Troy, Michigan that engaged in a financial and offering fraud in connection with two different types of securities.  First, the Complaint alleges that MCA sold $71 million of securitized interests in pools of mortgage loans from 1994 through 1999 while knowingly misrepresenting the risk, rate of return and historical performance of the interests in the offering materials.  The Complaint alleges that, as a result, investors lost at least $49 million.  Second, the Complaint alleges that MCA engaged in the fraudulent sale of $19 million in debentures between 1994 and 1999 by including financial statements that materially inflated its assets, income and equity in registration statements and annual and quarterly reports filed with the Commission.  The Complaint further alleges that MCA materially inflated its assets, income and equity by improperly: (1) recognizing gains on sale of real estate to related parties; (2) valuing certain mortgages held for resale; (3) failing to disclose related party mortgages held for resale; (4) failing to write down uncollectible related party receivables; and (5) failing to disclose MCAs potential liability in connection with the fraudulent sale of the securitized interests in pools of mortgage loans.  The Complaint alleges that as a result, investors in the debentures lost all $19 million invested.  , The Complaint alleges, among other things, that Lasky and the other six defendants violated, or aided and abetted violations of, the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws as a result of their involvement in MCAs fraudulent sale of securities.  The Complaint seeks, among other things, injunctive relief and civil penalties against Lasky and the other six defendants.  , Ajemian and Pietila also have pled guilty to federal criminal charges arising out of MCAs fraudulent scheme and have been sentenced.  Ajemian was sentenced to 37 months in prison and ordered to pay $256 million in restitution.  Pietila was sentenced to 48 months in prison and ordered to pay $256 million in restitution.  Wells and Swain have pled guilty to federal criminal charges arising out of MCAs fraudulent scheme but have not been sentenced yet.

The Court: (1) granted the Commissions request for a preliminary injunction; (2) appointed a permanent receiver; (3) continued a freeze on certain defendants assets; (4) prohibited the destruction of documents by the defendants; and (5) ordered accountings from the defendants., The Fund is headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada.  GECM, which is headquartered in Billings, Montana, was the sole manager of the Fund and was responsible for all of the Funds activities.  GE Securities, which is headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada, is registered with the Commission as a broker-dealer.  It offered and sold investments in the Fund; it did not offer or sell any other securities.  Farris, through a holding company, is the sole shareholder of GECM and GE Securities.  She also is the sole officer and director of GECM.  Reese is the president of GE Securities., The Commissions complaint alleges that, beginning in late 2001, the defendants offered and sold interests in the Fund, which purported to pool investor funds to purchase interests in mortgage loans and trust deeds and to pay regular monthly returns to investors from the interest earned from the Funds investments.  Prior to being temporarily enjoined on December 4, 2003, the Fund raised at least $48 million from about 600 investors nationwide.  The defendants promised, and actually paid to investors, a return on their investments equal to at least 12% annually.  The complaint alleges that, contrary to the defendants representations, the Fund was not generating sufficient interest income to pay the monthly distributions it was making to investors and, in fact, was operating as a Ponzi-like investment scheme.  The defendants were funding the monthly investor distributions with cash from new investors as well as with capital contributions from Farris and GECM and proceeds from the sale of non-cash assets of the Fund.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the Fund, aided and abetted by Farris, filed with the Commission materially false and misleading quarterly reports that misrepresented the financial condition of the Fund., The Commission obtained a preliminary injunction enjoining the defendants from committing securities fraud in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

No. 34-48951 (December 18, 2003).</h2>]","[On December 18, 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, against Charles D. Erwin, the former Chief Operating Officer of Hanover Compressor Company (Hanover), and against Michael J. McGhan, its former Chief Executive Officer, alleging that they orchestrated a managed earnings scheme to inflate the companys reported pre-tax income and meet Hanovers earnings goals and estimates during 2000 and 2001.  The complaint alleges that the scheme, together with internal control deficiencies, resulted in the overstatement of Hanovers pre-tax income during the relevant reporting periods in amounts ranging from 4.9% to 22.6%.  The SECs charges against Erwin and McGhan include securities fraud and other securities law violations.  To settle the SECs claims against them, McGhan and Erwin have agreed to pay a combined total of $672,171, and consent to permanent injunctions against future violations of the securities laws and five year bars from serving as an officer or director of a publicly held company., The Commission simultaneously instituted settled cease-and-desist proceedings against Hanover and against William S. Goldberg, Hanovers former interim Chief Financial Officer, based on Hanovers violations of the record keeping, reporting and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws and Goldbergs causing those violations.  In addition to the cease-and-desist order, Goldberg has agreed to pay a civil penalty of $50,000., Hanover is a Houston, Texas based company that manufactures, rents and operates natural gas compressors and other oil field equipment.  Hanovers common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange.  McGhan and Erwin are residents of Houston, and Goldberg resides in a Chicago suburb.   , According to the SECs allegations, Erwin and McGhan fraudulently inflated Hanovers reported pre-tax income during the third and fourth quarters of 2000, and Erwin inflated the companys reported pre-tax income during the second and third quarters of 2001, to meet Hanovers earnings goals and estimates.  The SEC alleges that Erwin and McGhan failed to inform Hanovers accountants - or, consequently, its auditors - about side agreements that should have precluded Hanover from recognizing revenue on sales of equipment in Nigeria.  The SEC alleges that Erwin also failed to inform Hanovers accountants - or, consequently, its auditors - about important facts relating to three turbine sales, and structured certain transactions to deceive Hanovers accountants and auditors about payments for the turbines.  As a result, according to the SEC, Hanover recognized revenue on those deals in contravention of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and included false financial statements in its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2000, and in its Forms 10-Q for the third quarter 2000 and the second and third quarters of 2001.  Additionally, the SEC alleges that Erwin benefited from the inflated financial statements by selling stock in a March 2001 secondary offering of Hanover common stock.  The SEC also claims that Hanovers deficient internal controls facilitated Erwin and McGhans misconduct, that McGhan, among others, was responsible for Hanovers deficient internal controls and record keeping, and that McGhan and Erwin were both responsible for the companys filing of false financial statements with the Commission., In the cease-and-desist proceeding against Hanover and Goldberg, the SEC found that Hanover failed to implement and maintain an adequate system of internal controls, which contributed to the record keeping and reporting failures that occurred when the company improperly recognized revenue on equipment deals and included false financial statements in annual and quarterly reports to the SEC.  The SEC further found that Goldberg, who was Hanovers executive vice president until early 2002 and its interim Chief Financial Officer from mid-2000 through January 2002, caused Hanovers violations of those provisions because he failed to address adequately Hanovers internal control deficiencies, in light of Hanovers rapid growth, and failed to review adequately the facts and circumstances underlying various transactions that Hanover recorded improperly.  , The SEC alleges that Erwin violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder, and aided and abetted Hanovers violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  The SEC alleges that McGhan violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and aided and abetted Hanovers violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Erwin and McGhan made, and the Commission accepted, an offer of settlement in which each defendant consents to a permanent injunction against further violations of the above provisions of the federal securities laws, the payment of a civil money penalty ($110,000 for Erwin and $80,000 for McGhan), and a five year bar against serving as an officer or director of a publicly held company.  Erwin will also disgorge $417,900 of illicit profits, plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $64,271, based on his sale of Hanover stock in March 2001., Hanover and Goldberg both consented to the entry of an order in the SECs cease-and-desist proceeding, which requires the company to cease and desist from violating, and requires Goldberg to cease and desist from causing violations of, Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.  Further, in a related civil proceeding against Goldberg, he has agreed to pay a civil penalty of $50,000., The SEC agreed to settle with Hanover on the above terms based on the companys cooperation in the investigation and the companys numerous remedial measures to ensure against violations of the securities laws in the future., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18514.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Tx.)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Daniel L. Gordon, former head of Merrill Lynchs Global Energy Markets Group, with securities violations in connection with his role in three separate illegal transactions.  The Commissions complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Houston, alleges that Gordon aided and abetted Enron Corp.s financial fraud by engaging in a risk-free energy trade that was designed to overstate Enrons reported 1999 income.  The Commissions complaint also alleges that Gordon falsified the books and records and circumvented the internal controls of Merrill Lynch in connection with two other transactions.  In one transaction, Gordon, through an offshore entity he controlled, created and sold a bogus electricity call option to Merrill Lynch and pocketed the $43 million option premium.  In the other transaction, Gordon and others allegedly falsified the earnings figures for his Merrill Lynch energy business in an effort to secure a high sales price for the business.  Gordons business was later sold to Allegheny Energy, Inc. based, allegedly, on the false earnings figures., Simultaneous with the filing of this action, the Commission has agreed to accept Gordons offer to settle this matter.  Gordon has agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2), and 13(b)(5) and of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, and 13b2-1 thereunder.  Gordon has also consented to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company under Section 21(d)(2) of the Exchange Act. , The Commissions complaint alleges that, in late December 1999, Gordon and others at Merrill Lynch entered into an energy transaction with Enron that they knew had the purpose and effect of inflating Enrons income by approximately $50 million.  The transaction involved two off-setting electricity call options - one physical and one financial.  As alleged, Gordon knew and explained to others at Merrill Lynch that the two options were back to back and delta-neutral, or, essentially, a wash.  Nevertheless, Gordon and others demanded a multi-million dollar fee for entering into the transaction because Enron was determined to complete the transaction by year-end 1999.  Enron ultimately agreed to pay Merrill Lynch a $17 million fee to close the transaction.  In 2000, Enron approached Gordon and others seeking to unwind the transaction before trading under the off-setting energy options was scheduled to begin.  As alleged in the complaint, Gordon learned that Enron had contemplated unwinding the transaction before the transaction had even closed.  The deal was unwound in June 2000 after Merrill Lynch agreed to reduce its fee to $8.5 million to terminate the transaction.  The complaint alleges that Gordon aided and abetted Enrons violations of the antifraud, reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with this transaction.  This transaction forms the basis, in part, for the Commissions action against Merrill Lynch and two of its executives filed on March 17, 2003.  [See Litigation Release 18038], In addition to aiding and abetting Enron fraud, the Commission alleges that Gordon also engaged in violative conduct in two other transactions.  First, the Commission alleges in its complaint that, in 2000, Gordon became aware that Merrill Lynch sought certain insurance to hedge obligations Merrill Lynch had assumed under a long-term energy contract.  As further alleged, Gordon identified a company that was purportedly willing and able to provide that insurance.  In fact, as alleged, the company was an offshore entity that Gordon controlled and had created for purposes of providing the insurance.  Gordon purported to negotiate with that entity to obtain the necessary insurance, in exchange for a payment by Merrill Lynch of $43 million.  Merrill Lynch agreed and paid the $43 million fee, which, as alleged, Gordon transferred to accounts under his control and for his benefit.  In connection with this conduct, the complaint alleges that Gordon knowingly falsified or caused to be falsified Merrill Lynchs books and records and knowingly circumvented Merrill Lynchs internal controls., In the final transaction, the Commission alleges that Gordon and others falsified the earnings figures for Merrill Lynchs Global Energy Markets (GEM) business for purposes of making the business more attractive to prospective purchasers.  As alleged, Gordon and others inflated GEMs earnings by creating a false justification for releasing approximately $40 million in reserves and recognizing it as income in 2000.  The complaint also alleges that Gordon was aware that others at Merrill Lynch had also improved GEMs financials by removing expenses and arbitrarily increasing the business 1999 revenue.  Gordon and others provided the falsified financial information for GEM to Allegheny Energy, Inc., which ultimately purchased the business.  In connection with this conduct, the complaint alleges that Gordon knowingly falsified or caused to be falsified Merrill Lynchs books and records and knowingly circumvented Merrill Lynchs internal controls., As noted above, Gordon has agreed to file a consent and final judgment settling the Commissions action against him.  In the consent, Gordon, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, has agreed to the entry of a permanent antifraud injunction prohibiting him from future violations of certain provisions of the federal securities laws.  Under the settlement, Gordon also will be barred permanently from serving as an officer or director of any public company.  In addition, Gordon has agreed to cooperate in the Commissions ongoing investigation., Also today, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York filed criminal charges against Gordon for his role in the sale of the bogus electricity call option and the falsification of books and records relating to GEM.  Gordon has agreed to plead guilty to these charges, pursuant to which he will forfeit the proceeds of his unlawful conduct., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York and the U.S. Department of Justice Enron Task Force in this matter.  The Commission also notes the continuing coordination among the Division of Enforcement, the Enron Task Force and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the Enron investigation., The Commissions investigation is continuing., For additional information, see:, <p align=center><img alt=* border=0 height=9 src=/images/dot_orange.gif width=6/> <img alt=* border=0 height=9 src=/images/dot_orange.gif width=6/> <img alt=* border=0 height=9 src=/images/dot_orange.gif width=6/> <img alt=* border=0 height=9 src=/images/dot_orange.gif width=6/> <img alt=* border=0 height=9 src=/images/dot_orange.gif width=6/>, <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18515.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  ]"

Fla.)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission), the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida and the United States Postal Inspection Service, Miami Division, announced the unsealing of a twenty-five count Indictment yesterday against Philip R. Gratz, a former stockbroker who conducted business as Phoenix World Wide Enterprises, Inc. (Phoenix).  On December 16, 2003, a federal grand jury sitting in Miami, Florida, returned an Indictment charging Gratz with nine counts of mail fraud, five counts of wire fraud, four counts of securities fraud, and seven counts of criminal contempt. The maximum penalty for mail, wire, and securities fraud charges is 20 years imprisonment as to each count; and there is no statutory maximum penalty for criminal contempt.  Gratz was arrested at his residence in Marlton, New Jersey., As background, on or about April 30, 1992, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida in the case of <i>SEC v. Delta Rental Systems, Inc., et al.</i>, Case No. 91-2136-CIV-DAVIS (S.D. Fla.) entered a Final Judgment of Permanent Injunction and Other Relief (the Permanent Injunction) against Gratz, which prohibited him from committing future violations of, among others, the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  In violation of the Permanent Injunction, from in or around November 1998, to in or around March 2003, Gratz, while doing business as Phoenix, conducted a scheme to defraud in which he raised approximately $8.9 million from various investors located in different states throughout the country, including investors residing in the Southern District of Florida.  , On March 20, 2003, the Commission filed an emergency civil contempt action against Gratz in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida in order to put a halt to the scheme.  In that action, the Commission charged Gratz with disobeying the provisions in the Permanent Injunction that enjoined him from future violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The following day, the Court granted the SECs request for emergency relief, entered a temporary asset freeze, and appointed a Receiver to take over Phoenix.  On May 20, 2003, with Gratzs consent, the Court entered an order on civil contempt sanctions, ordering Gratz to disgorge all ill-gotten gains, imposing an asset freeze, and awarding attorneys fees.  On October 22, 2003, with Gratzs consent, the Court entered a Final Judgment on Civil Contempt, ordering Gratz to disgorge $7,236,417, together $60,303.48 as prejudgment interest, which amount represents the proceeds he received.   , The Commissions filing of its emergency civil contempt action against Gratz in March 2003 was derived from the same activity that led to the indictment.  The indictment charges that to carry out his scheme, Gratz solicited individuals to invest money with him in return for guaranteed annual interest payments ranging from 25% to 50%.  During investor solicitations, Gratz falsely represented to investors, among other things, that he would invest all of their funds in the stock market.  In truth, Gratz misappropriated over $3 million in investor funds for his and his familys personal use and benefit, including to purchase, among other things, a luxury home, real estate properties, two Mercedes Benz automobiles, artwork, jewelry and watches, home furnishings, a vacation to St. Barthelemy, a country club membership; to lease a Range Rover sport utility vehicle; and to pay for personal credit card expenses, which included, among other things, vacations, airfare, lodging, cruises, limousines, restaurants, designer clothes, and retail store purchases.  According to the indictment, Gratz induced investors to invest money by making false statements and omissions of material facts concerning, among others, the use of investor funds, the profitability of Gratzs securities trading, and Gratzs prior criminal and disciplinary history.   The criminal contempt counts charged in the indictment stem from Gratzs violation of the Permanent Injunction., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18516.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Tex.)</h2>, <h2>CIBC Simultaneously Settles Charges, Consenting to a Permanent Anti-Fraud Injunction and Payment of $80 Million in Disgorgement, Penalties and Interest</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) today charged Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) and three of its executives with aiding and abetting Enron Corp.s securities fraud.  The Commissions complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Houston, alleges that CIBC and the three executives aided and abetted Enrons manipulation of its reported financial results through a series of complex structured finance transactions over a period of several years preceding Enrons bankruptcy.  The 34 financings were structured as asset sales for accounting and financial reporting purposes, allowing Enron to hide from investors and rating agencies the true extent of its borrowings.  Between June 1998 and October 2001, Enron used these disguised loans to increase reported earnings by more than $1 billion, to increase reported operating cash flows by almost $2 billion, and to avoid disclosure of more than $2.6 billion in debt on its financial statements.  Enrons alternative, borrowing money using the asset as collateral, would have given Enron access to cash to meet its operating expenses, but carried with it financial reporting consequences -- increased debt, no positive effect on cash flow, and no positive effect on earnings -- that would have had a detrimental impact on Enrons credit rating and stock price., Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint, CIBC consented to entry of a final judgment settling the Commissions action against it.  In the consent, CIBC has agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the antifraud, books and records, and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws [Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and (B), and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13 and 13b2-1].  CIBC also has agreed to pay $80 million: $37.5 million in disgorgement, a $37.5 million civil penalty and $5 million in prejudgment interest.  The Commission intends to have these funds paid into a court account pursuant to the Fair Fund provisions of Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Fair Fund) for ultimate distribution to victims of the fraud., Daniel Ferguson and Mark Wolf, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, also consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins each from violating the same antifraud, books and records, and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws.  In addition, Ferguson has agreed to pay a total of $563,000: disgorgement of $265,000, a penalty of $265,000, and prejudgment interest of $33,000, and has agreed to the entry of an order barring him from serving as an officer or director of a publicly traded company for a period of five years.  Wolf, who is no longer employed by CIBC, has agreed to pay a total of $60,000: $27,500 as disgorgement, a penalty of $27,500, and prejudgment interest of $5,000.  The Commission will likewise direct those monies to Enron fraud victims pursuant to the Fair Fund provisions.  Ian Schottlaender, a former managing director in CIBCs corporate leveraged finance group in New York City, is contesting the matter., As alleged in the Commissions complaint, the financings involved purported transfers of assets from Enron to Enron-sponsored off-balance sheet qualified special purpose entities (QSPEs) or special purpose entities (SPEs).  Enron treated these transfers as accounting sales pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statements No. 125 and 140, in order to book earnings and recognize operating cash flows, without reporting the associated debt on its financial statements.  CIBC organized a syndicate of banks to provide, in the form of debt, the majority of the capitalization of the QSPEs and SPEs.  Applicable accounting rules also require that a portion of their capitalization -- nominal in the case of a QSPE and at least three percent in the case of an SPE -- be equity unrelated to Enron and at risk of loss.  CIBC provided this outside equity at risk to validate the financings.  The accounting rules also require that the transferor, Enron, relinquish control over the assets, transferring the risk and rewards of ownership of the assets to the transferees., The complaint further alleges that the transactions met neither the requirement that the equity stake be at risk, nor the requirement that the transferor relinquish control over the asset.  With respect to the equity, the complaint alleges that a senior CIBC official directed Schottlaender to obtain commitments from Enron senior management that Enron would support CIBCs equity contribution.  In conversations between Andrew Fastow, Enrons CFO, and defendant Schottlaender, Fastow gave Schottlaender the strongest possible assurances that CIBCs equity would be repaid.  The defendants knew that this undocumented understanding could not be disclosed in written deal documents between Enron and CIBC because it would be fatal to the sale accounting treatment that  was the sole basis for the financings.  Within CIBC, the guaranteed equity stake in the Enron transactions was referred to as, among other things, trust me equity, a term attributed to Schottlaender.  Up to the date Enron filed for bankruptcy, consistent with the assurances, Enron fully repaid CIBC for its equity stake and the promised 15 percent return in each of the financings as they unwound or were settled, even when the assets had lost value., The complaint further alleges that Enron did not relinquish control over the assets. For example, the parties understood that Enron, not CIBC, was responsible for the ultimate disposition of each asset.  Consistent with this undocumented understanding, Enron or an Enron affiliate reacquired or refinanced each of the assets before the expiration date of the financing.  Similarly, CIBCs return on its equity stake was -- like a loan -- limited to its original investment and a stated yield of generally 15 percent.  In the event an asset appreciated beyond CIBCs limited contractual return, Enron structured the financings to receive any further increase in asset value, an increase generally considered a return on equity.  The complaint also points to the limited or no due diligence performed in connection with the transfers.  According to the complaint, the transactions were in fact a form of asset parking.  Both CIBC and Enron described the largest transaction structure as a short term revolving warehouse facility., The complaint alleges that although CIBC officials had concerns over whether Enron had financially engineered a large portion of its profits, CIBC was determined to achieve status as one of Enrons elite Tier I of banks.  CIBC earned approximately $18 million in fees from the fraudulent financings.  The disgorgement award of $37.5 million includes all the fees from the fraudulent transactions, as well as all relationship fees from any other transactions occurring at or after the date of the first fraudulent transaction.  CIBCs civil penalty also is based upon the total fees CIBC received from Enron from 1998 until Enrons demise., The Commission brought this action in coordination with the U.S. Department of Justice Enron Task Force, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the Canadian Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions., The Commissions investigation is continuing., For additional information, see, <p align=center><img alt=* border=0 height=9 src=/images/dot_orange.gif width=6/> <img alt=* border=0 height=9 src=/images/dot_orange.gif width=6/> <img alt=* border=0 height=9 src=/images/dot_orange.gif width=6/> <img alt=* border=0 height=9 src=/images/dot_orange.gif width=6/> <img alt=* border=0 height=9 src=/images/dot_orange.gif width=6/>, <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18517.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  ]"

The Commissions complaint alleges that the defendants fraudulently obtained approximately $1.4 million from over 30 investors in an unregistered offering of Opsis securities., The complaint alleges that the defendants deceived investors by falsely claiming that Opsis was on the verge of conducting an initial public stock offering, and by making baseless projections about the price at which Opsis stock would trade on the secondary market.

Patterson, the former chairman and chief executive officer of Tulsa-based Nesco, Inc., of securities fraud, bank fraud and tax-relegated offenses.  Patterson, 59, was convicted for his role in fraudulently inflating the accounts of Nesco, a former NASDAQ company once recognized by Fortune Small Business Magazine as one of Americas 100 fastest growing small companies (OTC: NESCQ).  Patterson is scheduled to be sentenced in March 2004.  Pattersons wife, Judith Ray Patterson, was also convicted of tax-related offenses., On May 7, 2003, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil securities fraud case in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma (Tulsa Division) against Patterson (see Lit. Rel No.  18125). The SEC charged Patterson with financial fraud and other securities law violations related to his orchestration of a false invoice scheme that inflated Nescos assets and revenue for its fiscal year 2000 and first quarter 2001 by over $2 million. The SECs action was brought in close coordination with the U. S. Attorneys Office in Tulsa, Oklahoma and the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation Division.  , According to the SECs complaint, Patterson was Nescos chairman and CEO at all relevant times until August 16, 2001, when the companys board of directors forced him to resign. Assisted by Nescos now deceased former controller, Patterson grossly overstated the companys earnings by booking 28 bogus customer invoices totaling $2,153,986 in the fourth quarter of 2000 and one invoice totaling $183,385 in the first quarter of 2001. These false invoices resulted in overstatements to Nescos pretax income for those periods of 400% and 175%, respectively. Nesco included these false figures in its annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. The complaint further alleges that Patterson, who had borrowed heavily to acquire large amounts of Nesco stock, devised the fraudulent scheme to conceal the companys dismal financial performance from investors, bolstering Nescos share price and preventing his personal financial ruin.  The SECs complaint further alleged that Patterson lied to Nescos auditor to prevent discovery of the scheme during its audit of the companys 2000 fiscal year. , According to the SECs complaint, Nescos management became suspicious of the companys financial statements for the 2000 fiscal year and commenced an internal investigation in May 2001. This investigation ultimately revealed Pattersons fraud and caused Nesco to compel his immediate resignation from the company on August 16, 2001. Further, Nesco voluntarily issued a press release disclosing its financial overstatements, restated its financial results for its fiscal year 2000 and first quarter 2001, and continued its internal investigation to ensure that it had uncovered the whole scheme and any other financial mismanagement. Nesco also fully cooperated with the SEC in its investigation of the matter.  , The SECs case, which is continuing, requests that Patterson be permanently enjoined from future securities violations, that a civil monetary penalty be assessed against him, that he be ordered to disgorge the full amount of compensation he received from Nesco during the relevant period, including salary and bonuses, with prejudgment interest, and that he be barred from serving in the future as an officer or director of a public company.  , On May 7, 2003, the SEC also announced the institution of cease-and-desist proceedings against Nesco based on the aforementioned misconduct. The SEC simultaneously accepted Nescos offer to consent to a cease-and-desist order. The order, in charging violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder, orders Nesco to cease and desist from committing or causing any future violations of the above books and records, reporting, and internal controls provisions.  , Additional information can be found in Litigation Release <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18125.htm>No. 18125</a> (May 7, 2003)., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18519.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Labertew as a defendant.  Labertew, age 39 of Park City, Utah, is the former securities counsel to Rocky Mountain.  The SEC filed the original lawsuit in April 2003 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, alleging that Rocky Mountain, its president, and its general counsel had engaged in a fraudulent pump-and-dump scheme involving Rocky Mountains stock.  , The amended complaint, from June 2002 to December 2002, Labertew participated in an illegal distribution of approximately 47 million shares of Rocky Mountain stock in four unregistered share-exchange transactions.  In connection with each transaction, Labertew prepared and filed a petition with a Utah state court on behalf of Rocky Mountain to obtain a court order approving the transaction pursuant to Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act of 1933.  Section 3(a)(10) exempts from registration securities exchanged for other securities or property interests, as long as a court approves the transaction after a fairness hearing.  The complaint alleges that, notwithstanding the courts approval, the Section 3(a)(10) exemption did not apply in this case because the four transactions were in fact shams forming part of a larger manipulation scheme orchestrated by Rocky Mountains president, defendant John Ehrman.  Labertew received 410,220 shares in the transactions, which he sold into the market for $62,088.  , In settlement of the SECs lawsuit against him and without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Labertew has consented to the entry of an agreed final judgment, permanently enjoining him from future violations of the securities-registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, ordering disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and ordering a civil penalty in the amount of $25,000.  In addition, Labertew, based upon the anticipated entry of the civil injunction above, has agreed to the entry of an SEC administrative order pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the SECs Rules of Practice, permanently suspending him from appearing or practicing as an attorney before the SEC., For additional information, see Litigation Release <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18069.htm>No. 18069</a> (April 3, 2003) and Litigation Release <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18305.htm>No. 18305</a> (August 22, 2003)., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18522.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18522.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The settlements also include Messiers agreement to relinquish his claims to a €21 million severance package that he negotiated just before he resigned his positions at Vivendi, and payment of disgorgement and civil penalties by Messier and Hannezo that total over $1 million., The Commissions Complaint describes a course of conduct by Vivendi, Messier, and Hannezo that disguised Vivendis cash flow and liquidity problems, improperly adjusted accounting reserves to meet earnings before income taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) targets, and failed to disclose material financial commitments, all in violation of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  , Specifically, the Commissions Complaint includes the following allegations: , All of the defendants consented to the settlements without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations.

The SECs complaint, filed yesterday in federal district court names James P. Lewis, Jr., of Laguna Niguel, California, who allegedly has sold securities in two funds, known as the Income Fund, Ltd. and the Growth Fund, Ltd., since 1983 through FAC., The Honorable Audrey B. Collins, United States District Judge for the Central District of California, issued a temporary restraining order against Lewis, which temporarily restrains him from committing future securities fraud violations and freezes the assets of Lewis, FAC, and the Funds., The Commissions complaint alleges that for almost 20 years, Lewis, doing business as FAC, sold interests in the Funds.  According to the Funds offering documents, the Income Fund purportedly invests in equipment leasing and insurance premium financing programs and has purportedly realized an average annual return of more than 19% per year since its inception in 1983; and the Growth Fund purportedly buys and sells distressed businesses and has purportedly realized an average annual return of almost 39% per year since its inception in 1987.  Lewis has paid about $1.6 million per month in regular withdrawals and about $4 to $7 million per month in other withdrawals.  Lewis, FAC, and the Funds are not registered with the Commission., The Commissions complaint further alleges that since about June 2003, Lewis has not honored many requests to withdraw monies by investors in the Funds.  Instead, Lewis has misrepresented to the investors that FACs and the Funds accounts had been frozen by the Department of Homeland Security.  The Commissions complaint alleges that the Department of Homeland Security has not frozen FACs and the Funds accounts, and that Lewis, either directly or indirectly, posed as a Department of Homeland Security official in an attempt to convince FAC administrative personnel that the freeze existed., The Commission complaint further alleges that while he has failed to honor many withdrawal requests, Lewis has been accepting new investments into the Funds, reinvesting the investors purported profits in the Funds, soliciting certain investors to make additional large investments in the Funds, and honoring certain investors withdrawal requests.  In addition, about the time that Lewis began to tell Fund investors that FACs and the Funds accounts had been frozen by the Department of Homeland Security, Lewis withdrew $3 million from his Income Fund account., The district courts order temporarily restrains Lewis from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Parmalat Finanziaria S.p.A.</i>, Case No. 03 CV 10266 (PKC) (S.D.N.Y.)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Parmalat Finanziaria S.p.A. (Parmalat) with securities fraud.  The Commissions complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York, alleges that Parmalat engaged in one of the largest and most brazen corporate financial frauds in history., The Commissions complaint alleges as follows:  From August through November 2003, Parmalat fraudulently offered $100 million of unsecured Senior Guaranteed Notes to U.S. investors by materially overstating the companys assets and materially understating its liabilities.  As Parmalat acknowledged in a press release dated December 19, 2003, the assets in its 2002 audited financial statements were overstated by at least €3.95 billion (approximately $4.9 billion).  In addition, Parmalat falsely stated to U.S. investors that it used its excess cash balances  which actually did not exist  to repurchase corporate debt securities worth €2.9 billion (approximately $3.6 billion), when in fact it had not repurchased those debt obligations and they remained outstanding.  The $100 million note offering failed after Parmalats auditors raised questions about certain Parmalat accounts., The complaint further alleges that as of the end of 2002, Parmalat purportedly held the €3.95 billion worth of cash and marketable securities in an account at Bank of America in New York City in the name of Bonlat Financing Corporation (Bonlat), a wholly owned subsidiary incorporated in the Cayman Islands.  Bonlats auditors certified its 2002 financial statements based upon a false confirmation that Bonlat held these assets at Bank of America.  The bank account and the assets did not exist and the purported confirmation had been forged.  These non-existent assets are reflected on Bonlats 2002 books and records and, in turn, in Parmalats 2002 consolidated financial statements, as well as in its consolidated financial statements as at June 30, 2003, which were provided to U.S. investors to whom Parmalat offered notes from August through November 2003.  The complaint further alleges that a private placement memorandum that Parmalat provided to U.S. investors in August 2003 contained numerous material misstatements about the companys financial condition.  For example, the memorandum falsely states:  Liquidity is high with significant cash and marketable securities balances....     , The complaint further alleges that on December 9, 2003, Parmalats Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and his son, a senior Parmalat executive, met with representatives from a New York City-based private equity and financial advisory firm regarding a possible leveraged buyout of Parmalat.  During that meeting, one of the New York firms representatives noted that Parmalats financial statements showed that the company had a large amount of cash.  In response, the son stated that the cash was not there, and that Parmalat really had only €500 million in cash.  Later, Parmalats Chief Financial Officer joined the meeting.  During a discussion of Parmalats outstanding debt, the CFO stated that Parmalats debt was actually €10 billion, much higher than the balance sheet showed.  The CFO indicated that the balance sheet was incorrect because the company had not repurchased €2.9 billion of Parmalat bonds.  The balance sheet falsely reflected that the bonds had been repurchased., The complaint further alleges that based on these revelations, the New York firms representatives offered to send members of the firms restructuring group to meet with Parmalat representatives.  The following day, representatives of the firms restructuring group met with the Parmalat representatives, and informed them that Parmalat needed to publicly disclose the facts disclosed to the New York firm if that firm were to continue to have any involvement.  When it became clear that the Parmalat representatives were unwilling to do so, the New York firms representatives terminated their discussions with Parmalat., The complaint further alleges that from 1998 through 2002, Parmalat and certain of its top managers and directors, including its then Chairman and CEO and its CFO, actively marketed and sold nearly $1.5 billion in notes and bonds to U.S. investors.  Parmalat also sponsored an American Depositary Receipts (ADR) program.  Parmalats ADRs were originally privately placed in the U.S. on August 9, 1996.  Before December 19, 2003, the price of Parmalat ADRs had been artificially inflated by the materially false and misleading statements described above.  , Parmalat is charged with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. The Commission seeks against Parmalat a permanent injunction from future securities fraud violations and a substantial civil penalty., The Commissions investigation into these events is continuing., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of Commissione Nazionale per la Società e la Borsa (Consob), the public authority responsible for regulating the Italian securities market., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18527.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18527.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The complaint also names Jon Patrick Pierce, president of Freedom Financial Group, Inc., a holding company that controls Presidents Trust, and David D. Klasna, formerly president of Presidents Trust.  Pierce and Klasna are residents of Omaha.  The complaint alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws., The complaint arises out of an offering of financial instruments called Fixed Income Trust-Secured (the Trusts) that Presidents Trust, through Pierce and Klasna, conducted during August and September 2003.  The defendants raised approximately $14 million from at least 150 investors nationwide, claiming that the Trusts were a safe, secure investment that would pay a higher rate of return than traditional conservative investments, such as bank certificates of deposits.  The offering was terminated when regulators from the South Dakota Division of Securities entered a cease-and-desist order against the offering., According to the complaint, the Trusts were not a safe or secure investment, but were essentially unsecured promissory notes issued by Presidents Trust.  The defendants allegedly misled investors by calling the instruments Trusts, when in fact Presidents Trust did not follow the fiduciary duties required for trustees.  Some of the proceeds were reinvested in Presidents Trust itself, and while the defendants told investors that they could reinvest proceeds in Presidents Trust, they did not disclose financial statements or other information about the financial condition of Presidents Trust.  In fact, Presidents Trust was strapped for cash at the time of the offering, and after the offering ceased, Presidents Trust submitted documents to the South Dakota Division of Banking showing that it was insolvent., Concurrently with the filing of the Commissions complaint, Presidents Trust and Pierce, without admitting or denying liability, consented to entry of permanent injunctions prohibiting future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.
